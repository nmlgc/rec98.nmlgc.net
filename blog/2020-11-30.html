<p>
	So, only one card-flipping function missing, and then we can start
	decompiling TH01's two final bosses? Unfortunately, that had to be the one
	big function that initializes and renders all gameplay objects. #17 on the
	list of longest functions in all of PC-98 Touhou, requiring two pushes to
	fully understand what's going on thereâ€¦ <i>and then it immediately returns
	for all "boss" stages whose number is divisible by 5, yet is still called
	during Sariel's and Konngara's initialization</i> ðŸ¤¦
</p><p>
	Oh well. This also involved the final file format we hadn't looked at
	yet â€“ the <code>STAGE?.DAT</code> files that describe the layout for all
	stages within a single 5-stage scene. Which, for a change is a very
	well-designed formâ€“ no, of course it's completely weird, what did you
	expect? Development must have looked somewhat like this:
</p><ul>
	<li>Weirdness #1: <i>{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} "Hm, the stage format should
	include the file names for the background graphics and musicâ€¦ or should
	it?"</i> And so, the 22-byte header still references some music and
	background files that aren't part of the final game. The game doesn't use
	<i>anything</i> from there, and instead derives those file names from the
	scene ID.<br />
	That's probably nothing new to anyone who has ever looked at TH01's data
	files. In a slightly more interesting discovery though, seeing the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-27" ".GRF extension"}}, in some of the file names
	that are short enough to not cut it off, confirms that .GRF was initially
	used for background images. Probably before ZUN learned about .PI, and how
	it achieves better compression than his own per-bitplane RLE approach?</li>
</ul><ul><li>
	<p>Weirdness #2: <i>{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} "Hm, I might want to put
	obstacles on top of cards?"</i> You'd probably expect this format to
	contain one single array for every stage, describing which object to place
	on every 32Ã—32 tile, if any. Well, the real format uses <i>two</i> arrays:
	One for the cards, and a combined one for all "obstacles" â€“ bumpers, bumper
	bars, turrets, and portals. However, none of the card-flipping stages in
	the final game come with any such overlaps. That's quite unfortunate, as it
	would have made for some quite interesting level designs:</p>
	<figure><a href="{{$pic}}"><img
		src="{{$pic}}"
		alt="Experimenting with putting obstacles on top of cards in TH01"
	/></a></figure>
	<p>As you can see, the final version of the blitting code was not written
	with such overlaps in mind either, blitting the <i>cards</i> on top of all
	the <i>obstacles</i>, and not the other way round.</p>
</li></ul><ul><li>
	<p>Weirdness #3: <i>{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} "In contrast to obstacles, of
	which there are multiple types, cards only really need 1 bit. Time for some
	bit twiddling!"</i> Not the worst idea, given that the 640Ã—336 playfield
	can fit 20Ã—10 cards, which would fit exactly into 25 bytes if you use a
	single bit to indicate <i>card</i> or <i>no card</i>. But for whatever
	reason, ZUN only stored 4 card bits per byte, leaving the other 4 bits
	unused, and needlessly blowing up that array to 50 bytes. ðŸ¤·</p>
	<p>Oh, and did I mention that the contents of the STAGE?.DAT files are
	loaded into the main data segment, even though the game immediately parses
	them into something more conveniently accessible? That's another 1250 bytes
	of memory wasted for no reasonâ€¦</p>
</li></ul><ul>
	<li>Weirdness #4: <i>{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} "Hm, how about requiring the
	player to flip some of the cards multiple times? But I've already written
	all this bit twiddling code to store 4 cards in 1 byte. And if cards should
	need anywhere from 1 to 4 flips, that would need at least 2 more bits,
	which won't fit into the unused 4 bits eitherâ€¦"</i> This feature
	<i>must</i> have come later, because the final game uses 3 "obstacle" type
	IDs to act as a flip count modifier for a card at the same relative array
	position. Complete with lookup code to find the actual card index these
	modifiers belong to, and ridiculous <i>switch</i> statements to not include
	those non-obstacles in the game's internal obstacle array.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</li></ul><p>
	With all that, it's almost not worth mentioning how there are 12 turret
	types, which only differ in which hardcoded pellet group they fire at a
	hardcoded interval of either 100 or 200 frames, and that they're all
	explicitly spelled out in every single <code>switch</code> statement. Or
	how the layout of the internal card and obstacle SoA classes is quite
	disjointed. So here's the new ZUN bugs you've probably already been
	expecting!
</p><hr /><p>
	Cards and obstacles are blitted to both VRAM pages. This way, any other
	entities moving on top of them can simply be unblitted by restoring pixels
	from VRAM page 1, without requiring the stationary objects to be redrawn
	from main memory. Obviously, the backgrounds behind the cards have to be
	stored somewhere, since the player can remove them. For faster transitions
	between stages of a scene, ZUN chose to store the backgrounds behind
	obstacles as well. This way, the background image really only needs to be
	blitted for the first stage in a scene.
</p><p>
	All that memory for the object backgrounds adds up quite a bit though. ZUN
	actually made the correct choice here and picked a memory allocation
	function that can return more than the 64 KiB of a single x86 Real Mode
	segment. He then accesses the individual backgrounds via regular array
	subscriptsâ€¦ and that's where the bug lies, because he stores the returned
	address in a regular <code>far</code> pointer rather than a
	<code>huge</code> one. This way, the game <i>still</i> can only display a
	total of 102 objects (i.&nbsp;e., cards and obstacles combined) per stage,
	without any unblitting glitches.<br />
	What a shame, that limit could have been 127 if ZUN didn't needlessly
	allocate memory for <i>alpha planes</i> when backing up VRAM content.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	And since array subscripts on <code>far</code> pointers wrap around after
	64 KiB, trying to save the background of the 103rd object is guaranteed to
	corrupt the memory block header at the beginning of the returned segment.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}. When TH01 runs in <strong>t</strong>est mode, it
	correctly reports a corrupted heap in this case.
</p><hr /><p>
	Finally, some unused content! Upon discovering TH01's stage selection debug
	feature, probably everyone tried to access Stage 21,
	just to see what happens, and indeed landed in an actual stage, with a
	black background and a weird color palette. Turns out that ZUN <i>did</i>
	ship an unused scene in <code>SCENE7.DAT</code>, which is exactly what's
	loaded there.<br />
	However, it's easy to believe that this is just garbage data (as I
	initially did): At the beginning of "Stage 22", the game seems to enter an
	infinite loop somewhere during the flip-in animation.
</p><p>
	Well, we've had a heap overflow above, and the cause here is nothing but a
	stack buffer overflow â€“ a perhaps more <i>modern</i> kind of classic C bug,
	given its prevalence in the Windows Touhou games. Explained in a few lines
	of code:
</p><pre>void stageobjs_init_and_render()
{
	int card_animation_frames[50]; // even though there can be up to 200?!
	int total_frames = 0;

	(code that would end up resetting total_frames if it ever tried to reset
	card_animation_frames[50]â€¦)
}</pre><p>
	The number of cards in "Stage 22"? 76. There you have it.
</p><p>
	But of course, it's trivial to disable this animation and fix these stage
	transitions. So here they are, Stages 21 to 24, as shipped with the game
	in <code>STAGE7.DAT</code>:
</p>
<figure class="side_by_side medium">{{range loop 21 25 -}}

	<a href="{{$picFN}}"><img

	/></a>
{{- end}}</figure><hr /><p>
	Wow, what a mess. All that was just a bit too much to be covered in two
	pushesâ€¦ Next up, assuming the current subscriptions: Taking a vacation with
	one smaller TH01 push, covering some smaller functions here and there to
	ensure some uninterrupted Konngara progress later on.
