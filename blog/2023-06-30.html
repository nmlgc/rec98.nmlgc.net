	And then, the supposed boilerplate code revealed yet another confusing issue
	that quickly forced me back to serial work, leading to no parallel progress
	made with Shuusou Gyoku after all. 🥲 The list of functions I put together
	for the first ½ of this push seemed so boring at first, and I was so sure
	that there was almost nothing I could possibly talk about:
</p><ul>
	<li>TH02's gaiji animations at the start and end of each stage, resembling
	opening and closing window blind slats. ZUN should have maybe not defined
	the regular whitespace gaiji as what's technically the last frame of the
	closing animation, but that's a minor nitpick. Nothing special there
	otherwise.</li>
	<li>The remaining spawn functions for TH04's and TH05's gather circles. The
	only dumb antic there is the way ZUN initializes the template for bullets
	fired at the end of the animation, featuring ASM instructions that are
	equivalent to what Turbo C++ 4.0J generates for the <code>__memcpy__</code>
	intrinsic, but show up in a different order. Which means that they must have
	been handwritten. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} I already figured that out in 2022
	though, so this was just more of the same.</li>
	<li>EX-Alice's override for the game's main 16×16 sprite sheet, loaded
	during her dialog script. More of a naming and consistency challenge, if
	anything.

	The rendering function for the big 48×48 explosion sprite, which <i>also</i>
	features the same clipping quirk?
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}</li>
</ul><p>
	That's three instances of ZUN removing sprites way earlier than you'd want
	to, intentionally deciding against those sprites flying smoothly in and out
	of the playfield. Clearly, there has to be a system and a reason behind it.
</p><p>
	Turns out that it can be almost completely blamed on master.lib. None of the
	<code>super_*()</code> sprite blitting functions can clip the rendered
	sprite to the edges of VRAM, and much less to the custom playfield rectangle
	we would actually want here. This is exactly the wrong choice to make for a
	game engine: Not only is the game developer now stuck with either rendering
	the sprite in full or not at all, but they're also left with the burden of
	manually calculating <i>when</i> not to display a sprite.<br />
	However, strictly limiting the top-left screen-space coordinate to
	(﻿0,&nbsp;0﻿) and the bottom-right one to (﻿640,&nbsp;400﻿) would actually
	stop rendering some of the sprites much earlier than the clipping conditions
	we encounter in these games. So what's going on there?
</p><p>
	The answer is a combination of playfield borders, hardware scrolling, and
	master.lib needing to provide at least <i>some</i> help to support the
	latter. Hardware scrolling on PC-98 works by dividing VRAM into two vertical
	partitions along the Y-axis and telling the GDC to display one of them at
	the top of the screen and the other one below. The contents of VRAM remain
	unmodified throughout, which raises the interesting question of how to deal
	with sprites that reach the vertical edges of VRAM. If the top VRAM row that
	starts at offset <code>0x0000</code> ends up being displayed <i>below</i>
	the bottom row of VRAM that starts at offset <code>0x7CB0</code> for 399 of
	the 400 possible scrolling positions, wouldn't we then need to vertically
	wrap most of the rendered sprites?<br />
	For this reason, master.lib provides the <code>super_roll_*()</code>
	functions, which unconditionally perform exactly this vertical wrapping. But
	this creates a new problem: If these functions still can't clip, and don't
	even know which VRAM rows currently correspond to the top and bottom row of
	the screen (since master.lib's <code>graph_scrollup()</code> function
	doesn't retain this information), won't we also see sprites wrapping around
	the <i>actual</i> edges of the screen? That's something we certainly
	wouldn't want in a vertically scrolling game…<br />
	The answer is yes, and master.lib offers no solution for this issue. But
	this is where the playfield borders come in, and helpfully cover 16 pixels
	at the top and 16 pixels at the bottom of the screen. As a result, they can
	hide up to 32 rows of potentially wrapped sprite pixels below them:

	The earliest possible frame that TH05 can start rendering the Stage 5
	midboss on. Hiding the text layer reveals how master.lib did in fact
	"blindly" render the top part of her sprite to the bottom of the
	playfield. That's where her sprite <i>starts</i> before it is correctly
	wrapped around to the top of VRAM.<br />
	If we scrolled VRAM by another 200 pixels (and faked an equally shifted
	TRAM for demonstration purposes), we get an equally valid game scene
	that points out why a vertically scrolling PC-98 game must wrap all sprites
	at the vertical edges of VRAM to begin with.
	<br />
	Also, note how the HP bar has filled up quite a bit before the midboss can
	actually appear on screen.

	And that's how the lowest possible top Y coordinate for sprites blitted
	using the master.lib <code>super_roll_*()</code> functions during the
	scrolling portions of TH02, TH04, and TH05 is not 0, but -16. Any lower, and
	you would <i>actually</i> see some of the sprite's upper pixels at the
	bottom of the playfield, as there are no more opaque black text cells to
	cover them. Theoretically, you <i>could</i> lower this number for
	<i>some</i> animation frames that start with multiple rows of transparent
	pixels, but I thankfully haven't found any instance of ZUN using such a
	hack. So far, at least… {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}<br />
	Visualized like that, it all looks quite simple and logical, but for days, I
	did <i>not</i> realize that these sprites were rendered to a scrolling VRAM.
	This led to a much more complicated initial explanation involving the
	invisible extra space of VRAM between offsets <code>0x7D00</code> and
	<code>0x7FFF</code> that effectively grant a hidden additional 9.6 lines
	below the playfield. Or even above, since PC-98 hardware ignores the highest
	bit of any offset into a VRAM bitplane segment
	(<code>&amp;&nbsp;0x7FFF</code>), which prevents blitting operations from
	accidentally reaching into a different bitplane. Together with the
	aforementioned rows of transparent pixels at the top of these midboss
	sprites, the math would have almost worked out exactly.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	The need for manual clipping also applies to the X-axis. Due to the lack of
	scrolling in this dimension, the boundaries there are much more
	straightforward though. The minimum left coordinate of a sprite can't fall
	below 0 because any smaller coordinate would wrap around into the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" "tile source area"}} and overwrite some of the
	pixels there, which we obviously don't want to re-blit every frame.
	Similarly, the right coordinate must not extend into the HUD, which starts
	at 448 pixels.<br />
	The last part might be surprising if you aren't familiar with the PC-98 text
	chip. Contrary to the CGA and VGA text modes of IBM-compatibles, PC-98 text
	cells can only use a single color for <i>either</i> their foreground or
	background, with the other pixels being transparent and always revealing the
	pixels in VRAM below. If you look closely at the HUD in the images above,
	you can see how the background of cells with gaiji glyphs is slightly
	brighter (<code style="color: #100">◼ #100</code>) than the opaque black
	cells (<code style="color: #000">◼ #000</code>) surrounding them. This
	rather custom color clearly implies that those pixels must have been
	rendered by the graphics GDC. If any other sprite was rendered below the
	HUD, you would equally see it below the glyphs.
</p><p>
	So in the end, I did find the clear and logical system I was looking for,
	and managed to reduce the new clipping conditions down to <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/48c18d6dac613f1478bc5873087285f17ebf5836/th02/main/playfld.hpp#L81-L120">a
	set of basic rules for each edge</a>. Unfortunately, we also need a second
	macro for each edge to differentiate between sprites that are smaller or
	larger than the playfield border, which is treated as either 32×32 (for
	<code>super_roll_*()</code>) or 32×16 (for non-"rolling"
	<code>super_*()</code> functions). Since smaller sprites can be fully
	contained within this border, the games can stop rendering them as soon as
	their bottom-right coordinate is no longer seen within the playfield, by
	comparing against the clipping boundaries with <code>&lt;=</code> and
	<code>&gt;=</code>. For example, a 16×16 sprite would be completely
	invisible once it reaches (﻿16,&nbsp;0﻿), so it would still be rendered at
	(﻿17,&nbsp;1﻿). A larger sprite during the scrolling part of a stage, like,
	say, the 64×64 midbosses, would still be rendered if their top-left
	coordinate was (﻿0,&nbsp;-16﻿), so ZUN used <code>&lt;</code> and
	<code>&gt;</code> comparisons to at least get an additional pixel before
	having to stop rendering such a sprite. Turbo C++ 4.0J sadly can't
	constant-fold away such a difference in comparison operators.
</p><p>
	And for the most part, ZUN did follow this system consistently. Except for,
	of course, the typical mistakes you make when faced with such manual
	decisions, like how he treated TH04's Stage 4 midboss as a "small" sprite
	below 32×32 pixels (it's 64×64), losing that precious one extra pixel. Or
	how the entire rendering code for the 48×48 boss explosion sprite pretends
	that it's actually 64×64 pixels large, which causes even the initial
	transformation into screen space to be misaligned from the get-go.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} But these are additional bugs on top of the single
	one that led to all this research.<br />
	Because that's what this is, a bug. 🐞 Every resulting pixel boundary is a
	systematic result of master.lib's unfortunate lack of clipping. It's as much
	of a bug as TH01's byte-aligned rendering of entities whose internal
	position is not byte-aligned. In both cases, the entities are alive,
	simulated, and partake in collision detection, but their rendered appearance
	doesn't accurately reflect their internal position.<br />
	Initially, I classified
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-11-30" "the sudden pop-in of TH05's Stage 5 midboss"}}
	as a quirk because we had no conclusive evidence that this wasn't
	intentional, but now we do. There have been multiple explanations for why
	ZUN put borders around the playfield, but master.lib's lack of sprite
	clipping might be the biggest reason.
</p><p>
	And just like byte-aligned rendering, the clipping conditions can easily be
	removed when porting the game away from PC-98 hardware. That's also what
	uth05win chose to do: By using OpenGL and not having to rely on hardware
	scrolling, it can simply place every sprite as a textured quad at its exact
	position in screen space, and then draw the black playfield borders on top
	in the end to clip everything in a single draw call. This way, the Stage 5
	midboss can smoothly fly into the playfield, just as defined by its movement
	code:
</p><figure {{$uth05win_regular.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $uth05win_regular.SetActive $uth05win_noborder}}
	<figcaption>
		The entire smooth Stage 5 midboss entrance animation as shown in

		don't know what will.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Meanwhile, I designed the interface of the {{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-05#blitperf"
	"generic blitter used in the TH01 Anniversary Edition"}} entirely around
	clipping the blitted sprite at any explicit combination of VRAM edges. This
	was nothing I tacked on in the end, but a core aspect that informed the
	architecture of the code from the very beginning. You <i>really</i> want to
	have one and <i>only</i> one place where sprite clipping is done right – and
	only once per sprite, regardless of how many bitplanes you want to write to.
</p><hr /><p>
	Which brings us to the goal that the final ¼ of this push went toward. I
	thought I was going to start cleaning up the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-10-20" "player movement and rendering code"}}, but
	that turned out too complicated for that amount of time – especially if you
	want to start with <i>just</i> cleanup, preserving all original bugs for the
	time being.<br />
	Fixing and smoothening player and Orb movement would be the next big task in
	Anniversary Edition development, needing about 3 pushes. It would start with
	more performance research into runtime-shifting of larger sprites, followed
	by extending my generic blitter according to the results, writing new
	optimized loaders for the original image formats, and finally rewriting all
	rendering code accordingly. With that code in place, we can then start
	cleaning up and fixing the unique code for each boss, one by one.
</p><p>
	Until that's funded, the code still contains a few smaller and easier pieces
	of code that are equally related to rendering bugs, but could be dealt with
	in a more incremental way. Line rendering is one of those, and first needs
	some refactoring of every call site, including
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-17" "the rotating squares around Mima"}} and
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-08" "YuugenMagan's pentagram"}}. So far, I managed
	to remove another 1,360 bytes from the binary within this final ¼ of a push,
	but there's still quite a bit to do in that regard.<br />
	This is the perfect kind of feature for smaller (micro-)transactions. Which
	means that we've now got meaningful TH01 code cleanup and Anniversary
	Edition subtasks at every price range, no matter whether you want to invest
	a lot or just a little into this goal.
</p><p>
	If you <i>can</i>, because {{DB_CustomerByID 13}} revealed the plan behind
	his Shuusou Gyoku contributions: A full-on Linux port of the game, which
	will be receiving all the funding it needs to happen. 🐧 Next up, therefore:
	Turning this into my main project within ReC98 for the next couple of
	months, and getting started by shipping the long-awaited first step towards
	that goal.<br />
	I've raised the cap to avoid the potential of rounding errors, which might
	prevent the last needed Shuusou Gyoku push from being correctly funded. I
	already had to pick the larger one of the two pending TH02 transactions for
	this push, because we would have mathematically ended up
	<sup>1</sup>/<sub>25500</sub> short of a full push with the smaller
	transaction. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} And if I'm already at it, I might
	as well free up enough capacity to potentially ship the complete OpenGL
	backend in a single delivery, which is currently estimated to cost 7 pushes
	in total.
