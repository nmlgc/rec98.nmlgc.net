	OK, TH01 missile bullets. Can we maybe have a well-behaved entity type,
	without any weirdness? Just <i>once</i>?
</p><p>
	Ehh, kinda. Apart from another 150 bytes wasted on unused structure members,
	this code is indeed more on the low end in terms of overall jank. It does
	become very obvious why dodging these missiles in the YuugenMagan, Mima, and
	Elis fights feels so awful though: An unfair 46√ó46 pixel hitbox around
	Reimu's center pixel, combined with the comeback of
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-12" "interlaced rendering"}}, this time in every
	stage. ZUN probably did this because missiles are the only 16√ó16 sprite in
	TH01 that is blitted to unaligned X positions, which effectively ends up
	touching a 32√ó16 area of VRAM per sprite.<br />
	But even <i>if</i> we assume VRAM writes to be the bottleneck here, it would
	have been totally possible to render every missile in every frame at roughly
	the same amount of CPU time that the original game uses for interlaced
	rendering:
</p><ul>
	<li>Note that all missile sprites only use two colors, white and green.</li>
	<li>Instead of naively going with the usual four bitplanes, extract the
	pixels drawn in each of the two used colors into their own bitplanes.
	master.lib calls this the "tiny format".</li>
	<li>Use the GRCG to draw these two bitplanes in the intended white and green
	colors, halving the amount of VRAM writes compared to the original
	function.</li>
	<li>(Not using the .PTN format would have also avoided the inconsistency of
	storing the missile sprites in boss-specific sprite slots.)</li>
</ul><p>
	That's an optimization that would have significantly benefitted the game, in
	contrast to <a href="/blog/tag/micro-optimization">all of the fake ones
	introduced in later games</a>. Then again, this optimization <i>is</i>
	actually something that the later games do, and it might have in fact been
	necessary to achieve their higher bullet counts without significant
	slowdown.
</p><p>
	Unfortunately, it was only worth decompiling half of the missile code right
	now, thanks to gratuitous FPU usage in the other half, where
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-06-13" "<code>double</code> variables are compared to <code>float</code> literals"}}.
	That one will have to wait
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-12" "until after SinGyoku"}}.
</p><hr /><p>
	After some effectively unused Mima sprite effect code that is so broken that
	it's impossible to make sense out of it, we get to the final feature I
	wanted to cover for all bosses in parallel before returning to Sariel: The
	separate sprite background storage for moving or animated boss sprites in
	the Mima, Elis, and Sariel fights. But, uh‚Ä¶ why is this necessary to begin
	with? Doesn't TH01 already reserve the other VRAM page for backgrounds?
	<br />
	Well, these sprites are quite big, and ZUN didn't want to blit them from
	main memory on every frame. After all, TH01 and TH02 had a minimum required
	clock speed of 33 MHz, half of the speed required for the later three games.
	So, he simply blitted these boss sprites to <i>both</i> VRAM pages, leading
	the usual unblitting calls to only remove the other sprites on top of the
	boss. However, these bosses themselves want to move across the screen‚Ä¶
	and this makes it necessary to save the stage background behind <i>them</i>
	in some other way.
</p><p>
	Enter .PTN, and its functions to capture a 16√ó16 or 32√ó32 square from VRAM
	into a sprite slot. No problem with that approach in theory, as the size of
	all these bigger sprites is a multiple of 32√ó32; splitting a larger sprite
	into these smaller 32√ó32 chunks makes the code look just a little bit clumsy
	(and, of course, slower).<br/>
	But somewhere during the development of Mima's fight, ZUN apparently forgot
	that those sprite backgrounds existed. And once Mima's üö´ casting sprite is
	blitted on top of her regular sprite, using just regular sprite
	transparency, she ends up with her infamous third arm:
</p><figure class="pixelated"><a href="{{$pic1}}"><img
	src="{{$pic1}}" alt="TH01 Mima's third arm" style="height: 320px"/></a>
</figure><p>
	Ironically, there's an unused code path in Mima's unblit function where ZUN
	assumes a height of 48 pixels for Mima's animation sprites rather than the
	actual 64. This leads to even clumsier .PTN function calls for the bottom
	128√ó16 pixels‚Ä¶ Failing to unblit the bottom 16 pixels would have also
	yielded that third arm, although it wouldn't have looked as natural. Still
	wouldn't say that it was intentional; maybe this casting sprite was just
	added pretty late in the game's development?
</p><hr /><p>
	So, mission accomplished, Sariel unblocked‚Ä¶ at 2¬º pushes. {{HTML_Emoji
	"thonk"}} That's quite some time left for some smaller stage initialization
	code, which bundles a bunch of random function calls in places where they
	logically really don't belong. The stage opening animation then adds a bunch
	of VRAM inter-page copies that are not only redundant but can't even be
	understood without knowing the hidden internal state of the last VRAM page
	accessed by previous ZUN code‚Ä¶<br />
	In better news though: Turbo C++ 4.0 really doesn't seem to have any
	complexity limit on inlining arithmetic expressions, as long as they only
	operate on compile-time constants. That's how we get macro-free,
	compile-time Shift-JIS to JIS X 0208 conversion of the individual code
	points in the Êù±Êñπ‚òÖÈùàÁï∞‰ºù string, in a compiler from 1994. As long as you
	don't store any intermediate results in variables, that is‚Ä¶
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	But wait, there's more! With still ¬º of a push left, I also went for the
	boss defeat animation, which includes the route selection after the SinGyoku
	fight.<br />
	As in all other instances, the 2√ó scaled font is accomplished by first
	rendering the text at regular 1√ó resolution to the other, invisible VRAM
	page, and then scaled from there to the visible one. However, the route
	selection is unique in that its scaled text is both drawn transparently on
	top of the stage background (not onto a black one), and can also change
	colors depending on the selection. It would have been no problem to unblit
	and reblit the text by rendering the 1√ó version to a position on the
	invisible VRAM page that isn't covered by the 2√ó version on the visible one,
	but ZUN (needlessly) clears the invisible page before rendering any text.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Instead, he assigned a separate VRAM color for both
	the È≠îÁïå and Âú∞ÁçÑ options, and only changed the <i>palette</i> value for
	these colors to white or gray, depending on the correct selection. This is
	another one of the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-12-18" "rare cases where TH01 demonstrates good use of PC-98 hardware"}},
	as the È≠îÁïå„Å∏ and Âú∞ÁçÑ„Å∏ strings don't need to be reblitted during the selection process, only the Orb "cursor" does.
</p><p>
	Then, why does this still not count as {{HTML_TagInline "good-code"}}? When
	changing palette colors, you <i>kinda</i> need to be aware of everything
	else that can possibly be on screen, which colors are used there, and which
	aren't and can therefore be used for such an effect without affecting other
	sprites. In this case, well‚Ä¶ hover over the image below, and notice how
	Reimu's hair and the bomb sprites in the HUD light up when Makai is
	selected:
<figure class="pixelated"><img
	src="{{$pic3}}"
	onmouseover="this.setAttribute('src', {{$pic2}});"
	onmouseout ="this.setAttribute('src', {{$pic3}});"
	alt="Demonstration of palette changes in TH01's route selection" />
</figure><p>
	This push did end on a high note though, with the generic, non-SinGyoku
	version of the defeat animation being an easily parametrizable copy. And
	that's how you decompile another 2.58% of TH01 in just slightly over three
	pushes.
</p><hr /><p>
	Now, we're not only ready to decompile Sariel, but also Kikuri, Elis, and
	SinGyoku without needing any more detours into non-boss code. Thanks to the
	current TH01 funding subscriptions, I can plan to cover most, if not all, of
	Sariel in a single push series, but the currently 3 pending pushes probably
	won't suffice for Sariel's 8.10% of all remaining code in TH01. We've got
	quite a lot of not specifically TH01-related funds in the backlog to pass
	the time though.
</p><p>
	Due to recent developments, it actually makes quite a lot of sense to take a
	break from TH01: <a href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a> has
	managed what every Touhou download site so far has failed to do: Bundling
	all 5 game onto a single .HDI together with <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/np2debug/commit/a40ad5c">pre-configured PC-98
	emulators</a> and a nice boot menu, and hosting the resulting package on a
	proper website. While this first release is already quite good (and much
	better than my attempt from 2014), there is still a bit of room for
	improvement to be gained from specific ReC98 research. Next up,
	therefore:
</p><ul>
	<li>Researching how TH04 and TH05 use EMS memory, together with the cause
	behind TH04's crash in Stage 5 when playing as Reimu without an EMS driver
	loaded, and</li>
	<li>reverse-engineering TH03's score data file format
	(<code>YUME.NEM</code>), which hopefully also comes with a way of building a
	file that unlocks all characters without any high scores.</li>
</ul>
