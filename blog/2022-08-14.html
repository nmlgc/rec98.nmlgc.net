	Last blog post before the 100% completion of TH01! The final parts of
	<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> would feel rather out of place in a celebratory
	blog post, after all. They provided quite a neat summary of the typical
	technical details that are wrong with this game, and that I now get to
	mention for one final time:
</p><ul>
	<li>The Orb's animation cycle is maybe two frames shorter than it should
	have been, showing its last sprite for just 1 frame rather than 3: <img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,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"
	alt="TH01's Orb animation cycle as an animated GIF, with frame durations
	proportional to the ones found in the game" /></li>
	<li>The text in the Pause and Continue menus is not <i>quite</i> correctly
	centered.</li>
	<li>The memory info screen hides quite a bit of information about the .PTN
	buffers, and obscures even the info that it <i>does</i> show behind
	misleading labels. The most vital information would have been that ZUN could
	have easily saved 20% of the memory by using a structure without the
	unneeded alpha plane… Oh, and the <span lang="ja">REWIRTE</span> option
	mapped to the ⬇️ down arrow key simply redraws the info screen. Might be
	useful after a <span lang="ja">NODE CHEAK</span>, which replaces the output
	with its own, but stays within the same input loop.</li>
</ul><p>
	But hey, there's an error message if you start <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>
	without a resident MDRV2 or a correctly prepared resident structure! And
	even a good, user-friendly one, asking the user to launch the batch file
	instead. For some reason, this convenience went out of fashion in the later
	games.
</p><hr /><p>
	The Game Over animation (how fitting) gives us TH01's final piece of weird
	sprite blitting code, which seriously manages to include 2 bugs and 3 quirks
	in under 50 lines of code. In debug mode, you can trigger this effect by
	pressing the ⬇️ down arrow key, which certainly explains why I encountered
	seemingly random Game Over events during all the tests I did with this
	game…<br />
	The animation appears to have changed quite a bit during development, to the
	point that probably even ZUN himself didn't know what he wanted it to look
	like in the end:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<div class="multilayer">

	</div>

		<span id="{{.Date}}-go-caption"></span>
	</figcaption>
</figure><hr /><p>
	Finally, we get to the big <code>main()</code> function, serving as the duct
	tape that holds this game together. It may read rather disorganized with all
	the (actually necessary) assignments and function calls, but the only
	<i>actual</i> minor issue I've seen there is that you're robbed of any
	pellet destroy bonus collected on the final frame of the final boss. There
	is a certain charm in directly nesting the infinite main gameplay loop
	within the infinite per-life loop within the infinite stage loop. But come
	on, why is there no fourth scene loop? {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Instead, the
	game just starts a new <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> process before and after a
	boss fight. With all the wildly mutated global state, that was probably a
	much saner choice.
</p><p>
	The final secrets can be found in the debug mode stage selection. ZUN
	implemented the prompts using the C standard library's <code>scanf()</code>
	function, which is the natural choice for quick-and-dirty testing features
	like this one. However, the C standard library is also complete and utter
	trash, and so it's not surprising that both of the <code>scanf()</code>
	calls do… well, probably not what ZUN intended. The guaranteed out-of-bounds
	memory access in the <code>select_flag</code> route prompt thankfully has no
	real effect on the game, but it gets really interesting with the <code
	lang="ja">面数 </code> stage prompt.<br />
	Back in 2020, I already wrote about
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-30" "stages 21-24, and how they're loaded from actual data that ZUN shipped with the game"}}.
	As it now turns out, the code that maps stage IDs to <code>STAGE?.DAT</code>
	scene numbers contains an explicit branch that maps any (1-based) stage
	number ≥21 to scene 7. Does this mean that an Extra Stage was indeed planned
	at some point? That branch seems way too specific to just be meant as a
	fallback. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcjhM4tfPq4&t=169s">Maybe
	Asprey was on to something after all…</a>
</p><p>
	However, since ZUN passed the stage ID as a signed integer to
	<code>scanf()</code>, you can also enter negative numbers. The only place
	that kind of accidentally checks for them is the aforementioned stage
	ID&nbsp;→&nbsp;scene mapping, which ensures that (1-based) stages &lt; 5 use
	the shrine's background image and BGM. With no checks anywhere else, we get
	a new set of "glitch stages":
</p><figure class="side_by_side medium">{{range loop 1 6 -}}
	{{- $pic := printf "TH01-Stage-minus-%d.png" . -}}
	{{- $picFN := (call $.PostFileURL $pic) -}}
	<figure>
		<a href="{{$picFN}}"><img
			src="{{$picFN}}"
			alt="TH01's stage -{{.}}"
	/></a><figcaption>Stage -{{.}}</figcaption>
	</figure>
{{- end}}</figure><p>
	The scene loading function takes the entered 0-based stage ID value modulo
	5, so these 4 are the only ones that "exist", and lower stage numbers will
	simply loop around to them. When loading these stages, the function accesses
	the data in <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> that lies before the statically
	allocated 5-element stages-of-scene array, which happens to encompass
	Borland C++'s locale and exception handling data, as well as a small bit of
	ZUN's global variables. In particular, the obstacle/card HP on the tile I
	highlighted in <span style="color: green;">green</span> corresponds to the
	lowest byte of the 32-bit RNG seed. If it weren't for that and the fact that
	the obstacles/card HP on the few tiles before are similarly controlled by
	the x86 segment values of certain initialization function addresses, these
	glitch stages would be completely deterministic across PC-98 systems, and
	<i>technically</i> canon… {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	Stage -4 is the only playable one here as it's the only stage to end up
	below the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-30" "heap corruption limit of 102 stage objects"}}.
	Completing it loads Stage -3, which crashes with a <code>Divide Error</code>
	just like it does if it's directly selected. Unsurprisingly, this happens
	because all 50 card bytes at that memory location are 0, so one division (or
	in this case, modulo operation) by the number of cards is enough to crash
	the game.<br />
	Stage -5 is modulo'd to 0 and thus loads the first regular stage. The only
	apparent broken element there is the timer, which is handled by a completely
	different function that still operates with a (0-based) stage ID value of
	-5. Completing the stage loads Stage -4, which also crashes, but only
	because its 61 cards naturally cause the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-30" "stack overflow in the flip-in animation for any stage with more than 50 cards"}}.
</p><p>
	And that's <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>, the biggest and most bloated PC-98
	Touhou executable, fully decompiled! Next up: Finishing this game with the
	main menu, and hoping I'll actually pull it off within 24 hours. (If I do,
	we might all have to thank <a

	System</a>, who independently decompiled half of the remaining 14
	functions…)
