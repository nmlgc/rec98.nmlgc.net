<p>
	No technical obstacles for once! Just pure overcomplicated ZUN code. Unlike
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-08-23" "Konngara's main function"}}, the main TH01
	player function was every bit as difficult to decompile as you would expect
	from its size.
</p><p>
	With TH01 using both separate left- and right-facing sprites for all of
	Reimu's moves <i>and</i> separate classes for Reimu's 32×32 and 48×*
	sprites, we're already off to a bad start. Sure, sprite mirroring is
	minimally more involved on PC-98, as the <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar
	nature of VRAM</a> requires the bits within an 8-pixel byte to also be
	mirrored, in addition to writing the sprite bytes from right to left. TH03
	uses a 256-byte lookup table for this, generated at runtime by an infamous
	micro-optimized and undecompilable ASM algorithm. With TH01's existing
	architecture, ZUN would have then needed to write 3 additional blitting
	functions. But instead, he chose to waste a total of 26,112 bytes of memory
	on pre-mirrored sprites… {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}
</p><p>
	Alright, but surely selecting those sprites from code is no big deal? Just
	store the direction Reimu is facing in, and then add some branches to the
	rendering code. And there is in fact a variable for Reimu's direction…
	during regular arrow-key movement, and <i>another</i> one while shooting and
	sliding, and a <i>third</i> as <i>part</i> of the special attack types,
	launched out of a slide.<br />
	Well, OK, technically, the last two are the same variable. But that's even
	worse, because it means that ZUN stores two distinct <code>enum</code>s at
	the same place in memory: Shooting and sliding uses <var>1</var> for left,
	<var>2</var> for right, and <var>3</var> for the "invalid" direction of
	holding both, while the special attack types indicate the direction in their
	lowest bit, with <var>0</var> for right and <var>1</var> for left. I
	decompiled the latter as bitflags, but in ZUN's code, each of the 8
	permutations is handled as a distinct type, with copy-pasted and adapted
	code… {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} The interpretation of this
	two-<code>enum</code> "sub-mode" <code>union</code> variable is controlled
	by yet another "mode" variable… and unsurprisingly, two of the bugs in this
	function relate to the sub-mode variable being interpreted incorrectly.
</p><p>
	Also, "rendering code"? This one big function basically consists of separate
	unblit→update→render code snippets for every state and direction Reimu can
	be in (moving, shooting, swinging, sliding, special-attacking, and bombing),
	pasted together into a tangled mess of nested <code>if(…)</code> statements.
	While a lot of the code is copy-pasted, there are still a number of
	inconsistencies that defeat the point of my usual refactoring treatment.
	After all, with a total of 85 conditional branches, anything more than I did
	would have just obscured the control flow too badly, making it even harder
	to understand what's going on.<br />
	In the end, I spotted a total of 8 bugs in this function, all of which leave
	Reimu invisible for one or more frames:
</p><ul>
	<li>2 frames after all special attacks</li>
	<li>2 frames after swing attacks, and</li>
	<li><i>4 frames</i> before swing attacks</li>
</ul><p>
	Thanks to the last one, Reimu's first swing animation frame is never
	actually rendered. So whenever someone complains about TH01 sprite
	flickering on an emulator: That emulator is accurate, it's the game that's
	poorly written. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	And guess what, this function doesn't even contain everything you'd
	associate with per-frame {{HTML_TagInline "player"}} behavior. While it does
	handle Yin-Yang Orb repulsion as part of slides and special attacks, it does
	not handle the actual player/Orb collision that results in lives being lost.
	The funny thing about this: These two things are done in the same function…
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	Therefore, the life loss animation is also part of another function. This is
	where we find the final glitch in this 3-push series: Before the 16-frame
	shake, this function only unblits a 32×32 area around Reimu's center point,
	even though it's possible to lose a life during the non-deflecting part of a
	48×48-pixel animation. In that case, the extra pixels will just stay on
	screen during the shake. They are unblitted afterwards though, which
	suggests that ZUN was at least somewhat aware of the issue?<br />
	Finally, the chance to see the alternate life loss sprite <img

	As for any new insights into game mechanics… you know what? I'm just not
	going to write anything, and leave you with this flowchart instead. Here's
	the definitive guide on how to control Reimu in TH01 we've been waiting for
	24 years:

	Pellets are deflected during all <span style="color: #aaa">gray</span>
	states. Not shown is the obvious "double-tap Z and X" transition from
	all non-(#1) states to the Bomb state, but that would have made this
	diagram even more unwieldy than it turned out. And yes, you can shoot
	twice as fast while moving left or right.

	With that monster of a function taken care of, we've only got boss sprite animation as the final blocker of uninterrupted Sariel progress. Due to some unfavorable code layout in the Mima segment though, I'll need to spend a bit more time with some of the features used there. Next up: The missile bullets used in the Mima and YuugenMagan fights.
