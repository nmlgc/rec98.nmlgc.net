	Secured a 22.5-hour RL workweek to leave plenty of time for this project,
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}}'s commissioned MediaWiki update work is also nearing
	completion, time to reopen the store! Since it's been a long time, here's
	an overview of where we currently are in each game and binary, and what
	the next logical step would be:
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>TH02:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> The final PC-98-specific low-level rendering functions are blocked by a single inconsistent and thus undecompilable assembly instruction. Rather than going for {{Blog_PostLink "2023-01-17" "code generation"}} and turning the rest of the function into a mess, I'd like to introduce a new build step between compilation and linking to patch "mistakes" like these. This would be an investment of 1-2 pushes into more readable code. Otherwise, I could continue with<ul>
			<li>bullets, including their weird hitboxes (once we reach 3 pushes),</li>
			<li>player character movement,</li>
			<li>player shots and the control code for the three shot types, or</li>
			<li>bomb rendering.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> <code>main()</code> and the congratulation picture screens.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH03:</strong><ul>
		<li><i>Interested in netplay? {{Blog_PostLink "2024-04-24" "This blog post details all possible approaches for implementing it. Make sure you've read it before investing into this game with netplay in mind."}}</i></li>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> Story Mode initialization or the title screenâ€¦ but most importantly, we want this to be at 100% RE so that we can build nice menus for future netplay.</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> The enemy structure? Or the bullet structure, maybe? Either way, we're still missing a lot of essential gameplay structures.</li>
		<li><code>MAINL.EXE:</code> The stage start screen, which will be nice to have for the {{Blog_PostLink "2023-07-28" "upcoming multilingual translations commissioned by Touhou Patch Center"}}.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH04:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> Finalizing the ZUN Soft logo animation, decompiling the game title slide-in animation, decompiling the High Score menu in parallel with TH05, and then we're done!</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code>
			There's a lot of partially reverse-engineered but not yet decompiled code, including all of this game's custom entity types. Covering that would significantly boost finalization% for very little money. Otherwise, we could go for either<ul>
				<li>Gengetsu's boss script</li>
				<li>HUD rendering (in parallel with TH05)</li>
				<li>player update code (in parallel with TH05), required for all midbosses in this game</li>
				<li>player shot control functions</li>
				<li>the end-of-stage bonus calculation</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> High score name entry.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH05:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> Finalizing the ZUN Soft logo animation, decompiling the High Score menu in parallel with TH04, and then we're done!</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> Got quite a lot of segment splits where we could immediately continue:<ul>
			<li>midboss and boss script code, either continuing with the in-game order and the Stage 2 midboss fight, or going directly for<ul>
				<li>Mai & Yuki,</li>
				<li>the Extra Stage midboss,</li>
				<li>or EX-Alice</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>stage tile rendering</li>
			<li>player update code (in parallel with TH04)</li>
			<li>items and extends</li>
			<li>bomb rendering</li>
			<li>the single-color areas of boss backgrounds, which use the GRCG's TDW mode</li>
			<li>HUD rendering (in parallel with TH05)</li>
			<li>boss sprite rendering boilerplate</li>
			<li>player shot collision detection and rendering</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> The staff roll animation.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>
	But as always, you can request pretty much any other part of any game.
	We're now at a pretty good place as far as arbitrary requests are
	concerned, as I simply can't decide myself where to put all the current
	pending contributions in the <a href="/fundlog">funding backlog</a>. ðŸ˜… By
	spending only the missing amount of money to complete any of those, you can
	capture any of those "fractional" contributions towards a specific goal.
</p><p>
	The next specific requests are going to set the priorities of this project
	for quite some time! The best strategy: Spend a low amount of money on
	something very specific, and watch as existing generic contributions will
	necessarily have to be put towards making that specific goal happen ðŸ˜›
