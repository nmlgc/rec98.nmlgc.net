	🎉 After almost 3 years, TH04 finally caught up to TH05 and is now 100%
	position-independent as well! 🎉
</p><p>
	For a refresher on what this means and does not mean, check the
	announcements from back in 2019 and 2020 when we chased the goal for TH05's
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-12-29" "<code>OP.EXE</code>"}} and
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-17" "the rest of the game"}}. These also feature
	some demo videos that show off the kind of mods you were able to efficiently
	code back then. With the occasional reverse-engineering attention it
	received over the years, TH04's code should now be slightly easier to work
	with than TH05's was back in the day. Although not by much – TH04 has
	remained relatively unpopular among backers, and only received more than the
	funded attention because it shares most of its core code with the more
	popular TH05. Which, coincidentally, ended up becoming
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-05-29" "the reason for getting this done now"}}.<br>
	Not that it matters a lot. Ever since we reached 100% PI for TH05, community
	and backer interest in position independence has dropped to near zero. We
	just didn't end up seeing the expected large amount of community-made mods
	that PI was meant to facilitate, and even the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-15" "100% decompilation of TH01"}} changed nothing
	about that. But that's OK; after all, I do appreciate the business of
	continually getting commissioned for <i>all</i> the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-03-05" "large-scale mods"}}. Not focusing on PI is
	also the correct choice for everyone who likes reading these blog posts, as
	it often means that I can't go that much into detail due to cutting corners
	and piling up technical debt left and right.
</p><p>
	Surprisingly, this only took 1.25 pushes, almost twice as fast as expected.
	As that's closer to 1 push than it is to 2, I'm OK with releasing it like
	this – especially since it was originally meant to come out three days ago.
	🍋 Unfortunately, it was delayed thanks to <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/commit/931197a58dd0b62b16b1294b353c4c3b5aac9e22">surprising
	website bugs</a> and a certain piece of code that was way more difficult to
	document than it was to decompile… The next push will have slightly less
	content in exchange, though.
</p><hr><p>
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-05-29" "P0240 and P0241"}} already covered the final
	remaining structures, so I only needed to do some superficial RE to prove
	the remaining numeric literals as either constants or memory addresses. For
	example, I initially thought I'd have to decompile the dissolve animations
	in the staff roll, but I only needed to identify a single function pointer
	type to prove all false positives as screen coordinates there. Now, the TH04
	staff roll would be another fast and cheap decompilation, similar to the
	custom entity types of TH04. (And TH05 as well!)
</p><p>
	The one piece of code I <i>did</i> have to decompile was Stage 4's carpet
	lighting animation, thanks to hex literals that were way too complicated to
	leave in ASM. And this one probably takes the crown for TH04's worst set of
	landmines and bloat that still somehow results in no observable bugs or
	quirks.<br>
	This animation starts at frame 1664, roughly 29.5 seconds into the stage,
	and quickly turns the stage background into a repeated row of dark-red plaid
	carpet tiles by moving out from the center of the playfield towards the
	edges. Afterward, the animation repeats with a brighter set of tiles that is
	then used for the rest of the stage. As I explained
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" "a while ago in the context of TH02"}}, the
	stage tile and map formats in PC-98 Touhou can't express animations, so all
	of this needed to be hardcoded in the binary.

</figure><p>
	And ZUN did start out making the right decision by only using fully-lit
	carpet tiles for all tile sections defined in <code>ST03.MAP</code>. This
	way, the animation can simply disable itself after it completed, letting the
	rest of the stage render normally and use new tile sections that are only
	defined for the final light level. This means that the "initial" dark
	version of the carpet is as much a result of hardcoded tile manipulation as
	the animation itself.<br>
	But then, ZUN proceeded to implement it all by directly manipulating the
	ring buffer of on-screen tiles. This is the lowest level before the tiles
	are rendered, and rather detached from the defined content of the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" ".MAP tile sections"}}. Which leads to a whole
	lot of problems:
</p><ol><li><p>
	If you decide to do this kind of tile ring modification, it should ideally
	happen at a very specific point: <i>after</i> scrolling in new tiles into
	the ring buffer, but <i>before</i> blitting any scrolled or invalidated
	tiles to VRAM based on the ring buffer. Which is not where ZUN chose to put
	it, as he placed the call to the stage-specific render function after both
	of those operations. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} By the time the function is
	called, the tile renderer has already blitted a few lines of the fully-lit
	carpet tiles from the defined .MAP tile section, matching the scroll speed.
	Fortunately, these are hidden behind the black TRAM cells above and below
	the playfield…
</p></li><li><p>
	Still, the code needs to get rid of them before they would become visible.
	ZUN uses the regular tile invalidation function for this, which will only
	cause actual redraws on the next frame. Again, the tile rendering call has
	already happened by the time the Stage 4-specific rendering function gets
	called.<br>
	But wait, this game also flips VRAM pages between frames to provide a
	tear-free gameplay experience. This means that the intended redraw of the
	new tiles actually hits the wrong VRAM page. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
	And sure, the code does attempt to invalidate these newly blitted lines
	every frame – but only relative to the current VRAM Y coordinate that
	represents the top of the hardware-scrolled screen. Once we're back on the
	original VRAM page on the next frame, the lines we initially set out to
	remove could have already scrolled past that point, making it impossible to
	ever catch up with them in this way.<br>
	The only real "solution": Defining the height of the tile invalidation
	rectangle at 3× the scroll speed, which ensures that each invalidation call
	covers 3 frames worth of newly scrolled-in lines. This is not intuitive at
	all, and requires an understanding of everything I have just written to even
	arrive at this conclusion. Needless to say that ZUN didn't comprehend it
	either, and just hardcoded an invalidation height that happened to be enough
	for the small scroll speeds defined in <code>ST03.STD</code> for the first
	30 seconds of the stage.
</p></li><li>
	The effect must consistently modify the tile ring buffer to "fix" any new
	tiles, overriding them with the intended light level. During the animation,
	the code not only needs to set the old light level for any tiles that are
	still waiting to be replaced, but also the new light level for any tiles
	that <i>were</i> replaced – and ZUN forgot the second part. {{HTML_Emoji
	"zunpet"}}  As a result, newly scrolled-in tiles within the already animated
	area will "remain" untouched at light level 2 if the scroll speed is fast
	enough during the transition from light level 0 to 1.
</li></ol><p>
	All that means that we only have to raise the scroll speed for the effect to
	fall apart. Let's try, say, 4 pixels per frame rather than the original
	0.25:
</p><figure {{$vid_hide.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_hide.FlipActive $vid_show}}
	<figcaption>
		By hiding the text RAM layer and revealing what's below the usually
		opaque black cells above and below the playfield, we can observe all
		three landmines – 1) and 2) throughout light level 0, and 3) during the
		transition from level 0 to 1.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	All of this could have been so much simpler and actually stable if ZUN
	applied the tile changes directly onto the .MAP. This is a much more
	intuitive way of expressing what is supposed to happen to the map, and would
	have reduced the code to the actually necessary tile changes for the first
	frame and each individual frame of the animation. It would have still
	required a way to force these changes into the tile ring buffer, but ZUN
	could have just used his existing full-playfield redraw functions for that.
	In any case, there would have been no need for <i>any</i> per-frame tile
	fixing and redrawing. The CPU cycles saved this way could have then maybe
	been put towards writing the tile-replacing part of the animation in C++
	rather than ASM…
</p><hr><p>
	Wow, that was an unreasonable amount of research into a feature that
	superficially works fine, just because its decompiled code didn't make
	sense. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} To end on a more positive note, here are
	some minor new discoveries that might actually matter to someone:
</p><ul><li>
	The laser part of Marisa's <i>Illusion Laser</i> shot type always does 3
	points of damage per frame, regardless of the player's power level. Its
	hitbox also remains identical on all power levels, no matter how wide the
	laser appears on screen. The strength difference between the levels purely
	comes from the number of <i>frames</i> the laser stays active before a fixed
	non-damaging 32-frame cooldown time:
