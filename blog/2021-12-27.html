<p>
	TH03 finally passed 20% RE, and the newly decompiled code contains no
	serious ZUN bugs! What a nice way to end the year.
</p><p>
	There's only a single unlockable feature in TH03: Chiyuri and Yumemi as
	playable characters, unlocked after a 1CC on any difficulty. Just like the
	Extra Stages in TH04 and TH05, <code>YUME.NEM</code> contains a single
	designated variable for this unlocked feature, making it trivial to craft a
	fully unlocked score file without recording any high scores that others
	would have to compete against. So, we can now put together a complete set
	for all PC-98 Touhou games: {{HTML_Download .HostedPath $dl}}
	It would have been cool to set the randomly generated encryption keys in
	these files to a fixed value so that they cancel out and end up not actually
	encrypting the file. Too bad that TH03 also started feeding each encrypted
	byte back into its stream cipher, which makes this impossible.
</p><p>
	The main loading and saving code turned out to be the second-cleanest
	implementation of a score file format in PC-98 Touhou, just behind TH02.
	Only two of the <code>YUME.NEM</code> functions come with nonsensical
	differences between <code>OP.EXE</code> and <code>MAINL.EXE</code>, rather
	than {{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-22" "all of them, as in TH01"}} or
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-12-28" "too many of them, as in TH04 and TH05"}}. As
	for the rest of the per-difficulty structure though… well, it quickly
	becomes clear why this was the final score file format to be RE'd. The name,
	score, and stage fields are directly stored in terms of the internal
	<code>REGI*.BFT</code> sprite IDs used on the high score screen. TH03 also
	stores 10 score digits for each place rather than the 9 possible ones, keeps
	any leading 0 digits, and stores the letters of entered names in reverse
	order… yeah, let's decompile the high score screen as well, for a full
	understanding of why ZUN might have done all that. (Answer: For no reason at
	all. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}})
</p><hr /><p>
	And wow, what a breath of fresh air. It's surely not
	{{HTML_TagInline "good-code"}}: The overlapping shadows resulting from using
	a 24-pixel letterspacing with 32-pixel glyphs in the name column led ZUN to
	do quite a lot of unnecessary and slightly confusing rendering work when
	moving the cursor back and forth, and he even forgot about the EGC there.
	But it's nowhere close to the level of jank we saw in
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-25" "TH01's high score menu"}} last year. Good to
	see that ZUN had learned a thing or two by his third game – especially when
	it comes to storing the character map cursor in terms of a character ID,
	and improving the layout of the character map:
</p><figure><a
	href="{{$pic}}"><img src="{{$pic}}" alt="The alphabet available for TH03 high score names." /></a>
</figure><p>
	That's almost a nicely regular grid there. With the question mark and the
	double-wide <i>SP</i>, <i>BS</i>, and <i>END</i> options, the cursor
	movement code only comes with a reasonable two exceptions, which are easily
	handled. And while I didn't get this screen <i>completely</i> decompiled,
	one additional push was enough to cover all important code there.
</p><p>
	The only potential glitch on this screen is a result of ZUN's continued use
	of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded
	decimal</a> digits without any bounds check or cap. Like the in-game HUD
	score display in TH04 and TH05, TH03's high score screen simply uses the
	next glyph in the character set for the most significant digit of any score
	above 1,000,000,000 points – in this case, the period. Still, it only
	<i>really</i> gets bad at 8,000,000,000 points: Once the glyphs are
	exhausted, the blitting function ends up accessing garbage data and filling
	the entire screen with garbage pixels. For comparison though, <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeoY6MEuDdA">the current world record
	is 133,650,710 points</a>, so good luck getting 8 billion in the first
	place.
</p><p>
	Next up: Starting 2022 with the long-awaited decompilation of TH01's Sariel
	fight! Due to the {{Blog_PostLink "2021-12-01" "recent price increase"}},
	we now got a <script>formatCurrency(3000)</script> window in the cap that
	is going to remain open until tomorrow, providing an early opportunity to
	set a new priority after Sariel is done.
