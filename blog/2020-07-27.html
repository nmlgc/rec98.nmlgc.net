	It's vacation time! Which, for ReC98, means "relaxing by looking at
	something boring and uninteresting that we'll ultimately have to cover
	anyway"… like the TH01 HUD.
</p><p>
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-18" "As noted earlier"}}, all the score, card
	combo, stage, and time numbers are drawn into VRAM. Which turns TH01's HUD
	rendering from the trivial, gaiji-assisted text RAM writes we see in later
	games to something that, once again, requires blitting and unblitting
	steps. For some reason though, everything on there is blitted to <i>both
	</i> VRAM pages? And that's why the HUD chose to allocate a bunch of .PTN
	sprite slots to store the background behind all "animated" elements at the
	beginning of a 4-stage scene or boss battle… <i>separately for every
	affected 16×16 area</i>. (Looking forward to the completely unnecessary
	code in the Sariel fight that updates these slots after the backgrounds
	were animated!) And without any separation into helper functions, we end
	up with the same blitting calls separately copy-pasted for every single
	HUD element. That's why something as seemingly trivial as this isn't even
	<i>done</i> after 2 pushes, as we're still missing the stage timer.
</p><p>
	Thankfully, the .PTN function signatures come with none of ZUN's little
	inconsistencies, so I was able to mostly reduce this copy-pasta to a bunch
	of small inline functions and macros. Those interfaces still remain a bit
	annoying, though. As a 32×32 format, .PTN merely supports 16×16 sprites
	with a separate bunch of functions that take an additional
	<code>quarter</code> parameter from 0 to 3, to select one of the 4 16×16
	quarters in a such a sprite…
</p><hr><p>
	For life and bomb counts, there was no way around VRAM though, since ZUN
	wanted to use more than a single color for those. This is where we find at
	least somewhat of a mildly interesting quirk in all of this: Any life
	counts greater than the intended 6 will wrap into new rows, with the bombs
	in the second row overlapping those excess lives. With the way the rest of
	the HUD rendering works, that wrapping code code had to be explicitly
	written… which means that ZUN did in fact accomodate (his own?) cheating
	there.

	Now, I promised image formats, and in the middle of this copy-pasta, we
	<i>did</i> get one… sort of. <code>MASK.GRF</code>, the red HUD
	background, is entirely handled with two small bespoke functions… and
	that's all the code we have for this format. Basically, it's a variation
	on the {{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-07" ".GRZ format we've seen earlier"}}. It
	uses the exact same RLE algorithm, but only has a single byte stream for
	both RLE commands and pixel data… as you would expect from an RLE format.
</p><p>
	.GRF actually stores 4 separately encoded RLE streams, which suggests that
	it was intended for full 16-color images. Unfortunately,
	<code>MASK.GRF</code> only contains 4 copies of the same HUD background
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}, so no unused beta data for us there. The only
	thing we <i>could</i> derive from 4 identical bitplanes would be that the
	background was originally meant to be drawn using color #15, rather than
	the <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span> seen in the final game. Color
	#15 is a stage-specific background color that <i>would</i> have made the
	HUD blend in quite nicely – in the YuugenMagan fight, it's the changing
	color of the <span lang="ja">邪</span> in the background, for example. But
	really, with no generic implementation of this format, that's all just
	speculation.
</p><p>
	Oh, and in case you were looking for a rip of that image:

><hr><p>
	So yeah, more of the usual TH01 code, with the usual small quirks, but
	nothing all too horrible – as expected. Next up: The image formats that
	didn't make it into this push.
