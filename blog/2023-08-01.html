	And then I'm even late by yet another two days… For some reason, preparing
	Shuusou Gyoku for an OpenGL port has been the most difficult and drawn-out
	task I've worked on so far throughout this project. These pushes were in
	development since April, and over two months in total. Tackling a legacy
	codebase with such a rather vague goal while simultaneously wanting to keep
	everything running did not do me any favors, and it was pretty hard to
	resist the urge to fix <i>everything</i> that had better be fixed to make
	this game portable…<br />
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-12-31" "2022 ended with Shuusou Gyoku working at full speed on Windows ≥8 by itself"}}, without external tools, for the first
	time. However, since it all came down to just one small bugfix, the
	resulting build still had several issues:
</p><ul>
	<li>The game might still start in the slow, <q>mitigated</q> 8-bit or 16-bit
	mode if the respective app compatibility flag is still present in the
	registry from the earlier {{Blog_PostLink "2022-09-04" "P0217 build"}}. A
	player would then have to manually put the game into 32-bit mode via the
	Option menu to make it run at its actual intended speed. Bypassing this flag
	programmatically would require some rather fiddly .EXE patching techniques.
	(<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/33">#33</a>)</li>
	<li>The 32-bit mode tends to lag significantly if a lot of sprites are
	onscreen, for example when canceling the final pattern of the Extra Stage
	midboss. (<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/35">#35</a>)</li>
	<li>If the game window lost and regained focus during the ending (for
	example via Alt-Tabbing), the game reloads the wrong sprite sheet. (<a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/19">#19</a>)</li>
	<li>And, of course, we still have no native windowed mode, or support for
	rendering in the higher resolutions you'd want to use on modern high-DPI
	displays. (<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/7">#7</a>)</li>
</ul><p>
	Now, we could tackle all of these issues one by one, in focused pushes… or
	wait for one hero to fund a full-on OpenGL backend as part of the larger
	goal of porting this game to Linux. This would take much longer, but fix all
	these issues at once while bringing us significantly closer to Shuusou Gyoku
	being cross-platform. Which is exactly what {{DB_CustomerByID 13}} did.
</p><hr /><p>
	Shuusou Gyoku is a <i>very</i> Windows-native codebase. Its usage of types
	declared in <code>&lt;windows.h&gt;</code> even extends to core gameplay
	code, the rendering code is completely architected around DirectDraw's
	features and drawbacks, and text rendering is not abstracted at all. Looks
	like it's now my task to write all the abstractions that pbg didn't manage
	to write…<br />
	Therefore, I chose to stay with DirectDraw for a few more pushes while I
	would build these abstractions. In hindsight, this was the least efficient
	approach one could possibly imagine for the exact goal of porting the game
	to Linux. Suddenly, I had to <i>understand</i> all this  DirectDraw and GDI
	jank, just to keep the game running at every step along the way. Retaining
	Shuusou Gyoku's 8-bit mode in particular was a huge pain, but I didn't want
	to remove it because it's currently the only way I can easily debug the game
	in windowed mode at a scaled resolution, through <a
	href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/">DxWnd</a>. In 16-bit or
	32-bit mode, DxWnd slows down to a crawl, roughly resembling the performance
	drop we used to get with Windows' own compatibility mitigations for the
	original build.<br />
	The upside, though, is that everything I've built so far still works with
	the original 8-bit and 16-bit graphics modes. And with just <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/43">one compiler flag to disable
	any modern x86 instructions</a>, my build can still run on <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_(original)">i586/P5 Pentium
	CPUs</a>, and only requires <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/43">KernelEx and its latest
	Kstub822 patches</a> to run on Windows 98. And, surprisingly, <a
	href="https://twitter.com/Columbio184/status/1685823332300562433">my core
	audience does appreciate this fact</a>. Thus, I will include an i586 build
	in all of my upcoming Shuusou Gyoku releases from now on. Once this codebase
	can compile into a 64-bit binary (which will obviously be required for a
	native Linux build), the i586 build will remain the only 32-bit Windows
	build I'll include in my releases.
</p><hr /><p>
	So, what was DirectDraw? In the shortest way that still describes it
	accurately from the point of view of a developer: "A hardware acceleration
	layer over Ye Olde Win32 GDI, providing double-buffering and fast blitting
	of rectangles." There's the <i>primary</i> double-buffered framebuffer
	surface, the <dfn>offscreen surfaces</dfn> that you create (which are
	comparable to what 3D rendering APIs would call <i>textures</i>), and you
	can blit rectangular regions between the two. That's it. Except for
	double-buffering, DirectDraw offers no feature that GDI wouldn't also
	support, while not covering some of GDI's more complex features. I mean,
	DirectDraw can blit rectangles only? <a
	href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-plgblt">How
	lame.</a> {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	However, DirectDraw's relative lack of features is not as much of a problem
	as it might appear at first. The reason for that lies in what I consider to
	be DirectDraw's actual killer feature: compatibility with GDI's <dfn>device
	context</dfn> (DC) abstraction. By acquiring a DC for a DirectDraw surface,
	you can use all existing GDI functions to draw onto the surface, and, in
	general, it will all just work. 😮 Most notably, you can use GDI's blitting
	functions (i.e., <code>BitBlt()</code> and friends) to transfer pixel data
	from a GDI <code>HBITMAP</code> in system memory onto a DirectDraw surface
	in video memory, which is the easiest and most straightforward way to, well,
	<i>get sprite data onto a DirectDraw surface in the first place</i>.<br />
	In theory, you could do that without ever touching GDI by locking the
	surface memory and writing the raw bytes yourself. But in practice, you
	probably won't, because your game has to run under multiple bit depths and
	your data files typically only store one copy of all your sprites in a
	single bit depth. And the necessary conversion and palette color matching…
	is a mere implementation detail of GDI's blitting functions, using a
	supposedly optimized code path for every permutation of source and
	destination bit depths.
</p><p>
	All in all, DirectDraw doesn't look too bad so far, does it? Fast blitting,
	and you can still use the full wealth of GDI functions whenever needed… at
	the small cost of potentially losing your surface memory at any time. 🙄
	Yup, if a DirectDraw game runs in true resolution-changing fullscreen mode
	and you switch to the Windows desktop, all your surface memory is freed and
	you have to manually restore it once the game regains focus, followed by
	manually copying all intended bitmap data back onto all surfaces. DirectDraw
	is where this concept of surface loss originated, which later carried over
	to the earlier versions of Direct3D and, <a
	href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110708090748/http://braid-game.com/news/2009/01/the-jeff-and-casey-show-on-visual-studio-2010-and-direct2d/">infamously,
	Direct2D</a> as well.<br />
	Looking at it from the point of view of the mid-90s, it does make sense to
	let the application handle trashed video memory if that's an unfortunate
	reality that your graphics API implementation has to deal with. You don't
	want to retain a second copy of each surface in a less volatile part of
	memory because you didn't have that much of it. Instead, the application can
	now choose the most appropriate way to restore each individual surface. For
	procedurally generated surfaces, it could just re-run the generating code,
	whereas all the fixed sprite sheets could be reloaded from disk.
</p><p>
	In practice though, this well-intentioned freedom turns into a huge pain.
	Suddenly, it's no longer enough to load every sprite sheet once before it's
	needed, blit its pixel data onto the DirectDraw surface, and forget about
	it. Now, the renderer must also be able to refresh the pixel data of every
	surface <i>from within itself</i> whenever any of DirectDraw's blitting
	functions fails with a <code>DDERR_SURFACELOST</code> error. This fact alone
	is enough to push your renderer interface towards central management and
	allocation of surfaces. You could <i>maybe</i> avoid the conceptual
	<code>SurfaceManager</code> by bundling each surface with a regeneration
	callback, but why should you? Any other graphics API would work with
	straight-line procedural load-and-forget initialization code, so why slice
	that code into little parts just because of some DirectDraw quirk?
</p><p>
	So if your surfaces can get trashed at any time, <i>and</i> you already use
	GDI to copy them from system memory to DirectDraw-managed video memory,
	<i>and</i> your game features at least one procedurally generated surface…
	you might as well retain every currently loaded surface in the form of an
	additional GDI device-independent bitmap. 🤷 In fact, that's even better
	than what Shuusou Gyoku did originally: For all .BMP-sourced surfaces, it
	only kept a buffer of the entire decompressed .BMP file data, which means
	that it had to recreate said intermediate GDI bitmap every time it needed to
	restore a surface. The in-game music title <i>was</i> originally restored
	via regeneration callback that re-rendered the intended title directly onto
	the DirectDraw surface, but this was handled by an additional "restore hook"
	system that remained unused for anything else.<br />
	Anything more involved would be a micro-optimization, especially since the
	goal is to get <i>away</i> from DirectDraw here. Not much point in "neatly"
	reloading sprite surfaces from disk if the total size of all loaded sprite
	sheets barely exceeds the 1 MiB mark. Also, keeping these GDI DIBs loaded
	and initialized <i>does</i> speed up getting back into the game… in theory,
	at least. After all, the game still runs in fullscreen mode, and resolution
	switching already takes longer on modern flat-panel displays than any
	surface restoration method we could come up with.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><hr /><p>
	So that was all pretty annoying. But once we start rendering in 8-bit mode,
	it gets even worse as we suddenly have to bother with palette management.
	Similar to <a href="/blog/tag/th01/palette">PC-98 Touhou</a>, Shuusou Gyoku
	uses <i>way</i> too many different palettes. In fact, it <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/e6267e99dfaac467bf42d0336c3675c74c2441af/DirectXUTYs/DD_UTY.CPP#L694-L705">creates
	a separate DirectDraw palette to retain the palette embedded into every
	loaded .BMP file, and simply sets the palette of the primary surface and the
	backbuffer to the one it loaded last</a>. Like, why would you retain
	per-surface palettes, and what effect does this even have? What even happens
	when you blit between two DirectDraw surfaces that have different palettes?
	Might this be the cause of the discolored in-game music title when playing
	under DxWnd? 😵<br /> But if we try throwing out those extra palettes, it
	only takes until Stage 3 for us to be greeted with… the infamous golf
	course:
</p><figure class="singleplayer_playfield">
	<img src="{{$st03_pal}}" alt="Shuusou Gyoku's Stage 3 if it only used the palette it loaded last" /><figcaption>
		Looks familiar? You might remember these colors from your attempts to <a
		href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/index.php?title=Shuusou_Gyoku/Gameplay&diff=prev&oldid=336642#Running_on_the_latest_computers">run

">
	<img src="{{$st03_face}}" /><span>
	As you might have guessed, these exact colors come from Gates' face sprite,
	whose palette apparently doesn't match the sprite sheets used in Stage 3.
	Turns out that 256 colors are not enough for what Shuusou Gyoku would like
	to use across the entire stage. In sprite loading order:</span>

</table></figure><p>
	And that's why Shuusou Gyoku does not only have to retain these palettes,
	but also contains <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/17894644715b372468f73b52eea1078e93b03344/GIAN07/SCROLL.CPP#L361-L369">stage
	script commands</a> (!) to switch the current palette back to either the map
	or enemy one, after the dialog system enforced the face palette.
</p><p>
	But the worst aspects about palettes rear their ugly head at the boundary
	between GDI and DirectDraw, when GDI adds its own palettes into the mix.
	None of the following points are clearly documented in either ancient or
	current MSDN, forcing each new DirectDraw developer to figure them out on
	their own:
</p><ul>
	<li>When calling <code>IDirectDraw::CreateSurface()</code> in 8-bit mode,
	DirectDraw automatically sets up the newly created surface with a reference
	(not a copy!) to the palette that's currently assigned to the primary
	surface.</li>
	<li>When locking an 8-bit surface for GDI blitting via
	<code>IDirectDrawSurface::GetDC()</code>, DirectDraw is supposed to set the
	GDI palette of the returned DC to the current palette of the DirectDraw…
	<i>primary surface</i>?! Not the surface you're actually calling
	<code>GetDC()</code> on?!<br />
	Interestingly, it took until March of this year for DxWnd to <a
	href="https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/issues/219">discover a
	different game that relied on this detail</a>, while DDrawCompat had
	implemented it for years. DxWnd version 2.05.95 then introduced the
	<i>DirectX(2) → Fix DC palette</i> tweak, and it's this option that would
	fix the colors of the in-game music title on any Shuusou Gyoku build older
	than P0251.</li>
	<li>Make sure to <i>never</i> <code>BitBlt()</code> from a 24-bit RGB GDI
	image to a palettized 8-bit DirectDraw offscreen surface. You might be
	tempted to just go 24-bit because there's no palette to worry about and you
	can retain a single GDI image for every supported bit depth, but the
	resulting palette mapping glitches will be much worse than if you just
	stayed in 8-bit. If you want to procedurally generate a GDI bitmap for a
	DirectDraw surface, for example if you need to render text, just <a
	href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createcompatiblebitmap">create
	a bitmap that's <i>compatible</i> with the DC of DirectDraw's primary or
	backbuffer surface</a>. Doing that magically removes all palette woes, and
	<code>CreateCompatibleBitmap()</code> is much easier to call anyway.</li>
</ul><p>
	Ultimately, all of this is why Shuusou Gyoku's original DirectDraw backend
	looks the way it does. It might seem redundant and inefficient in places,
	but pbg did in fact discover the only way where all the undocumented GDI and
	DirectDraw color mapping internals come together to make the game look as
	intended. 🧑‍🔬<br />
	And what else are you going to do if you want to target old hardware? My
	PC-9821Nw133, for example, can only run the original Shuusou Gyoku in 8-bit
	mode. For a Windows game on such old hardware, 8-bit DirectDraw looks like
	the only viable option. You certainly don't want to use GDI alone, because
	that's probably slow and you'd have to worry about <a
	href="https://www.compuphase.com/palette.htm">even more palette-related
	issues</a>. Although people have reported that Shuusou Gyoku does actually
	run faster on their old Windows 9x machine if they <i>disable</i> DirectDraw
	acceleration…?<br />
	In that case, it might be worth a try to write a completely new 8-bit
	software renderer, employing the same retained VRAM techniques that the
	PC-98 Touhou games used to implement their scrolling playfields with a
	minimum of redraws. The hardware scrolling feature of the PC-98 GDC would
	then be replicated by blitting the playfield in two halves every frame. I
	wonder how fast that would be…<br />
	Or you go straight back to DOS, and bring your own font renderer and
	MIDI/PCM sound driver. {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><hr /><p>
	So why did we have to learn about all this? Well, if GDI functions can
	directly render onto any kind of DirectDraw surface, this also includes text
	rendering functions like <code>TextOut()</code> and <code>DrawText()</code>.
	If you're <i>really</i> lazy, you can even render your text directly onto
	the DirectDraw backbuffer, which <i>probably</i> re-rasterizes all glyphs
	every frame!<br />
	Which, you guessed it, is exactly how Shuusou Gyoku renders most of its
	text. 🐷 Granted, it's not too bad with MS Gothic thanks to its embedded
	bitmaps for <a
	href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402134225/http://tomtia.plala.jp/pc/ttfont/#step04">font
	heights between 7 and 22 inclusive</a>, which replace the usual Bézier curve
	rasterization for TrueType fonts with a rather quick bitmap lookup. However,
	it would not only become a hypothetical problem if future translations end
	up choosing more complex fonts without embedded bitmaps, but also as soon as
	we port the game to other systems. Nobody in their right mind would
	integrate a cross-platform font renderer directly with a 3D graphics API… <a
	href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/opengl/font-and-text-functions"><span
	class="hovertext" title="I haven't tried this one for obvious non-portability reasons, but having to specify a *range* of glyphs already means that it's going to be a disaster for Japanese text.">right?</span></a>
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	Instead, let's refactor the game to render all its existing text to and from
	a <span class="hovertext" title="Remember, we have to keep all images as both GDI bitmaps and DirectDraw surfaces.">bitmap</span>,
	extending the way the in-game music title is rendered to the rest of the
	game. Conceptually, this is also how the Windows Touhou games have always
	rendered their text. Since they've always used Direct3D, they've always had
	to blit GDI's output onto a texture. Through the definitions in
	<code>text.anm</code>, this fixed-size texture is then turned into a sprite
	sheet, allowing every rendered line of text to be individually placed on the
	screen and animated.<br />
	However, the static nature of both the sprite sheet and the texture caused
	its fair share of problems for thcrap's translation support. Some of the
	sprites, particularly the ones for spell card titles, don't originally take
	up the entire width of the playfield, cutting off translations long before
	they reach the left edge. Consequently, thcrap's <a
	href="https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap-tsa/tree/master/base_tsa">base patch
	for the Windows Touhou games</a> has to resize the respective sprites to
	make translators happy. Before I added <a
	href="https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap/releases/tag/2018-10-22">.ANM header
	patching in late 2018</a>, this had to be done through a complete modified
	copy of <code>text.anm</code> for every game – with possibly additional
	variants if ZUN changed the layout of this file between game versions. Not
	to mention that it's bound to be quite annoying to manually allocate a
	rectangle for every line of text we want to show. After all, I have <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/36">at least</a> <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/12">two</a> text-heavy future
	features in mind already…
</p><p>
	So let's not do <i>exactly</i> that. Since DirectDraw wants us to manage all
	surfaces in a central place, we keep the idea of using a single surface for
	all text. But instead of predefining anything about the surface layout, we
	fully build up the surface at runtime based on whatever rectangles we need,
	using a <a href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D">rectangle
	packing</a> algorithm… yup, I wouldn't have expected to enter such territory
	either. For now, we still hardcode a fixed size that each piece of text is
	allowed to maximally take up. But once we get translations, nothing is
	stopping us from dynamically extending this size to fit even longer strings,
	and fitting them onto the fixed screen space via smooth scrolling.<br />
	To prevent the surface from arbitrarily growing as the game wants to render
	more and more text, we also reset all allocated rectangles whenever the game
	state changes. In turn, this will also recreate the text surface to match
	the new bounding box of all rectangles before the first prerendering call
	with the new layout. And if you remember the first bullet point about
	DirectDraw palettes in 8-bit mode, this also means that the text surface
	automatically receives the current  palette of the primary surface, giving
	us correct colors even without requiring DxWnd's DC palette tweak. 🎨
</p><p>
	In fact, the need to dynamically create surfaces at custom sizes was the
	main reason why I had to look into DirectDraw surface management to begin
	with. The original game <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/7dcab4f00881e7d9211b3f9d4229a78fe9a509e9/GIAN07/LOADER.CPP#L46-L84">created
	all of its surfaces at once</a>, at startup or after changing the bit depth
	in the main menu, which was a bad idea for many reasons:
</p><ul>
	<li>It hardcoded and limited the size of all sprite sheets,</li>
	<li>added another rendering-API-specific function that game code should not
	need to worry about,</li>
	<li>introduced surface <i>IDs</i> that have to be synchronized with the
	surface <i>pointers</i> used throughout the rest of the game,</li>
	<li>and was the main reason why the game had to distribute the six 320×240
	ending pictures across two of the fixed 640×480 surfaces, which ended up
	causing the <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/19">sprite reload
	bug in the ending</a>. As implied in the issue, this was a DirectDraw bug
	that pretty much had to fix itself before I could port the game to OpenGL,
	and was the only bug where this was the case. Check the issue comments for
	more details about this specific bug.
</ul><p>
	In the end, we get four different layouts for the text surface: One for the
	main menu, the Music Room, the in-game portion, and the ending. With,
	perhaps surprisingly, not too much text on either of them:
</p><figure><figure class="side_by_side small">
	<img src="{{$pack_0}}" alt="The font-rendered text from Shuusou Gyoku's sound option menu, packed into a texture." />
	<img src="{{$pack_1}}" alt="The font-rendered text from Shuusou Gyoku's Music Room, packed into a texture." />
	<img src="{{$pack_2}}" alt="The font-rendered text from Shuusou Gyoku's Stage 1, packed into a texture." />
	<img src="{{$pack_3}}" alt="The font-rendered text from Shuusou Gyoku's ending, packed into a texture." />
</figure><figcaption>
	Yes, the ending uses just a single rectangle that takes up the entire screen
	space below the pictures and credits.<br />
	For the menus, the resulting packed layout reveals how I'm assigning a
	separately cached rectangle to each possible option – otherwise, they
	couldn't be arranged vertically on screen with this bitmap layout. Right
	now, I'm only storing all text for the current menu level, which requires
	text to be rendered again when entering or leaving submenus. However, I'm
	allocating as many rectangles as required for the submenu with the most
	amount of items to at least prevent the single text surface from being
	resized while navigating through the menu. As a side effect, this is also
	why you can see multiple <code>Exit</code> labels: These simply come from
	other submenus with more elements than the currently visited <code>Sound /
	Music</code> one.
</figcaption></figure><p>
	Still, we're re-rasterizing whole lines of text exactly as they appear on
	screen, and are even doing so multiple times to apply any drop shadows.
	Isn't that exactly what every text rendering tutorial nowadays advises
	against doing? Why not directly go for the classic solution to this problem
	and render using a <a
	href="https://straypixels.net/texture-packing-for-fonts/">font texture
	atlas</a>? Well…
</p><ul>
	<li>Most of the game text is still in Japanese. If we were to build a font
	atlas in advance, we'd have to add a separate build step that collects all
	needed codepoints by parsing all text the game would ever print, adding a
	build-time dependency on the original game's copyrighted data files. We'd
	also have to move all hardcoded strings to a separate file since we surely
	don't want to parse C++ manually during said build step. Theoretically, we
	would then also give up the idea of modding text at run-time without
	re-running that build step, since we'd restrict all text to the glyphs we've
	rasterized in the atlas… yeah, that's more than enough reasons for static
	atlas generation to be a non-starter.<br />
	OK, then let's build the atlas dynamically, adding new glyphs as we
	encounter them. Since this game is old, we can even be a bit lazy as far as
	the packing is concerned, and don't have to get as fancy as the GIF in the
	link above. Just assume a fixed height for each glyph, and fill the atlas
	from left to right. We can even clear it periodically to keep it from
	getting too big, like before entering the Music Room, the in-game portion,
	or the ending, or after switching languages once we have translations.
	Should work, right?</li>
	<li>Except that most text in Shuusou Gyoku comes with a shadow, realized by
	first drawing the same string in a darker color and displaced by a few
	pixels. With a 3D renderer, none of this would be an issue because we can
	define vertex colors. But we're still using DirectDraw, which has no way of
	applying any sort of color formula – again, all it can do is take a
	rectangle and blit it somewhere else. So we can't just keep one atlas with
	white glyphs and let the renderer recolor it. Extending Shuusou Gyoku's
	Direct3D code with support for textured quads is also out of the question
	because then we wouldn't have any text in the Direct3D-less 8-bit mode. So
	what do we do instead? Throw the atlas away on every color change? Keep
	multiple atlases for every color we've seen so far? Turn shadows into a
	high-level concept? Outright forgetting the idea seems to be the best choice
	here…</li>
	<li>For a rather square language like Japanese where one Shift-JIS codepoint
	always corresponds to one glyph, a texture atlas can work fine and without
	too much effort. But once we support languages with more complex ligatures,
	we suddenly need to get a <a
	href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/why-do-i-need-a-shaping-engine.html">shaping
	engine</a> from somewhere, and directly interact with it from our rendering
	code. This necessarily involves changing APIs and maybe even bundling the
	first cross-platform libraries, which I wanted to avoid in an already packed
	and long overdue delivery such as this one. If we continue to render
	line-by-line, translations would only need a line break algorithm.</li>
	<li>Most importantly though: <i>It's not going to matter anyway.</i> The
	game ran fine on early 2000s hardware even though it called
	<code>TextOut()</code> every frame, and any approach that caches the result
	of this call is going to be faster.</li>
</ul><p>
	While the Music Room and the ending can be easily migrated to a prerendering
	system, it's much harder for the main menu. Technically, <i>all</i> option
	strings of the currently active submenu are rewritten every frame, even
	though that would only be necessary for the scrolling MIDI device name in
	the <code>Sound / Music</code> submenu. And since all this rewriting is done
	via a classic <code>sprintf()</code> on fixed-size <code>char</code>
	buffers, we'd have to deploy our own change detection before prerendering
	can have any performance difference.<br />
	In essence, we'd be shifting the text rendering paradigm from the original
	immediate approach to a more retained one. If you've ever used any of the
	hot new immediate-mode GUI or web frameworks that have become popular over
	the last 10 years, your alarm bells are probably already ringing by now.
	Adding retained elements is always a step back in terms of code quality, as
	it increases complexity by storing UI state in a second place.
</p><p>
	Wouldn't it be better if we could just stay with the original immediate
	approach then? Absolutely, and we only need a simple cache system to get
	there. By remembering the string that was last rendered to every registered
	rectangle, the text renderer can offer an immediate API that combines the
	distinct <code>Prerender()</code> and <code>Blit()</code> steps into a
	single <code>Render()</code> call. There still has to be an initialization
	point that registers all rectangles for each game state (which,
	surprisingly, was not present for the in-game portion in the original code),
	but the rendering code remains architecturally unchanged in how we call the
	text renderer every frame. As long as the text doesn't change, the text
	renderer just blits whatever it previously rendered to the respective
	rectangle. With an API like this, the whole pre-rendering part turns into a
	mere implementation detail.
</p><p>
	So, how much faster is the result? Since I can only measure non-VSynced
	performance in a quite rudimentary way using DxWnd's FPS counter, it highly
	depends on the selected renderer. Weirdly enough, even just switching font
	<i>creation</i> to the Unicode APIs tripled the FPS inside the Music Room
	when rendering with OpenGL? That said, the <i>primary surface</i> renderer
	seems to yield the most realistic numbers, as we still stay entirely within
	DirectDraw and perform no API wrapping. Using this renderer, I get speedups
	of roughly:
</p><ul>
	<li>~3.5× in the Music Room,</li>
	<li>~1.9× during in-game dialog, and</li>
	<li>~1.5× in the main menu.</li>
</ul><p>
	Not bad for something I had to do anyway to port the game away from
	DirectDraw! Shuusou Gyoku is rather infamous among the vintage computer
	scene for being ridiculously unoptimized, so I should definitely be able to
	get some performance gains out of the in-game portion as well.
</p><p>
	For a final test of all the new blitting code, I also tried running
	<i>outside</i> DxWnd to verify everything against real and unpatched
	DirectDraw. Amusingly, this revealed how blitting from the new text surface
	seems to reach the color mapping limits of the DWM mitigation in 8-bit mode:
</p><figure class="fullres pixelated">
	<img src="{{$discolor}}" alt="" />
	<figcaption>
		For some reason, my system maps the intended <code>#FFFFFF</code> text
		color to <code>#E4E3BB</code> in the main menu?
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	8-bit mode does render correctly when I ran the same build in a Windows 98
	VirtualBox on the same system though, so it's not worth looking into a mode
	that the system reports as unsupported to begin with. Let's leave this as
	somewhat of a visual reminder for players to select 32-bit mode instead.
</p><hr /><p>
	Alright, enough about the annoying parts of GDI and DirectDraw for now.
	Let's stop looking back and start looking forward, to a time within this
	Seihou revolution when we're going to have lots of new options in the main
	menu. Due to the nature of delivering individual pushes, we can expect lots
	of revisions to the config file format. Therefore, we'd like to have a
	backward-compatible system that allows players to upgrade from any older
	build, including the original <code>秋霜玉.exe</code>, to a newer one. The
	original game predominantly used single-byte values for all its options, but
	we'd like our system to work with variables of any size, including strings
	to store things like <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/14">the
	name of the selected MIDI device</a> in a more robust way. Also, it's pure
	evil to reset the entire configuration just because someone tried to
	hex-edit the config file and didn't keep the checksum in mind.
</p><p>
	It didn't take long for me to arrive at a common
	<code>Size()</code>/<code>Read()</code>/<code>Write()</code> interface. By
	using the same interface for both arrays and individual values, new config
	file versions can naturally expand older ones by taking the array of option
	references from the previous version and wrapping it into a new array,
	together with the new options.<br />
	The classic way of implementing this in C++ involves a typical
	object-oriented class hierarchy: An <code>Option</code> base class would
	define the interface in the form of virtual abstract functions, and the
	<code>Value</code>, <code>Array</code>, and <code>ConfigVersion</code>
	subclasses would provide different implementations. This works, but
	introduces quite a bit of boilerplate, not to mention the runtime bloat from
	all the virtual functions which Visual C++ can't inline. Why should we do
	<i>any</i> runtime dispatch here? We know the set of configuration options
	at compile time, after all… {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><p>
	Let's try looking into the modern C++ toolbox and see if we can do better.
	The only real challenge here is that the array type has to support
	arbitrarily sized option value types, which sounds like a job for
	<i>template parameter packs</i>. If we save these into a
	<code>std::tuple</code>, we can then "iterate" over all options with <a
	href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/apply"><code>std::apply</code></a>
	and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold">fold
	expressions</a>, in a nice functional style.<br />
	I was amazed by just how clearly the "crazy" modern C++ approach with
	template parameter packs, <code>std::apply()</code> over giant
	<code>std::tuple</code>s, and fold expressions beats a classic polymorphic
	hierarchy of abstract virtual functions. With the interface moved into an
	even optional <code>concept</code>, the class hierarchy can be completely
	flattened, which surprisingly also makes the code easier to both read and
	write.
</p><p>
	Here's how the new system works from the player's point of view:
</p><ul>
	<li>The config files now use a kanji-less and explicitly forward-compatible
	naming scheme, starting with <code>SSG_V00.CFG</code> in the P0251 build.
	The format of this initial version simply includes all values from the
	original <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code> without padding bytes or a checksum. Once
	we release a new build that adds new config options, we go up to
	<code>SSG_V01.CFG</code>, and so on.</li>
	<li>When <i>loading</i>, the game starts at its newest supported config file
	version. If that file doesn't exist, the game retries with each older
	version in succession until it reaches the last file in the chain, which is
	always the original <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>. This makes it possible to
	upgrade from any older Shuusou Gyoku build to a newer one while retaining
	all your settings – including, most importantly, which shot types you
	unlocked the Extra Stage with. The newly introduced settings will simply
	remain at their initial default in this case.</li>
	<li>When <i>saving</i>, the game always writes all versions it knows about,
	down to and including the original <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>, in the
	respective version-specific format. This means that you can change options
	in a newer build and they'll show up changed in older builds as well if they
	were supported there.<br />
	And yes, this also means that we can stop writing the unsupported 32-bit bit
	depth setting to <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>, which would cause a validation
	failure on the original build. This is now avoided by simply turning 32-bit
	into 16-bit just for the configuration that gets saved to this file. And
	speaking of validation failures…</li>
	<li>The <code>SSG_V*.CFG</code> files don't use checksums at all, which
	allows you to freely hex-edit them. Each configuration value is now
	validated individually, and reset to its default if you hex-edited it to
	something invalid. In the future, <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/12">we could even show an
	in-engine window at startup that lists these invalid options and the
	defaults they were reset to, if we get backer support for this idea.</a><ul>
		<li>This per-value validation is also done if my builds loaded the
		original <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>. The checksum is still written for
		compatibility with the original build, but my builds ignore it.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	With that, we've got more than enough code for a new build:
</p><p>
	<a class="release" href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/releases/tag/P0251">
	{{HTML_Emoji "sh01"}} Shuusou Gyoku P0251</a>
</p><p>
	This build also contains two more fixes that didn't fit into the big
	DirectDraw or configuration categories:
</p><ul>
	<li>The P0226 build had a bug that allowed invalid stages to be selected for
	replay recording. If the <code>ReplaySave</code> option was
	<code>[O&nbsp;F&nbsp;F]</code>, pressing the ⬅️ left arrow key on the
	<code>StageSelect</code>
	option would overflow its value to 255. The effects of this weren't all too
	serious: The game would simply stay on the Weapon Select screen for an
	invalid stage number, or launch into the Extra Stage if you scrolled all the
	way to 131. Still, it's fixed in this build.<figure class="fullres
	pixelated">
		<img src="{{$replay_255}}" alt="Screenshot of the negative overflow bug that the P0226 build of Shuusou Gyoku accidentally introduced into the replay stage selection" />
		<figcaption>Whoops! That one was fully my fault.</figcaption>
	</figure></li>
	<li>The render time for the in-game music title is now roughly cut in half: <figure class="singleplayer_playfield pixelated">
		{{call .VideoPlayer $mtitle_orig.SetActive.SetNoLoop $mtitle_P0251.SetNoLoop}}
	<figcaption>
		Achieved by simply trimming trailing whitespace and using slightly more

		These videos also show off how DxWnd's DC palette bug affected the
		original game, and how it doesn't affect the P0251 build.
	</figcaption></figure></li>
</ul><p>
	These 6 pushes still left several of Shuusou Gyoku's DirectDraw portability
	issues unsolved, but I'd better look at them once I've set up a basic OpenGL
	skeleton to avoid any more premature abstraction. Since the ultimate goal is
	a Linux port, I might as well already start looking at the current best
	platform layer libraries. SDL would be the standard choice here, and while
	SDL_ttf looks regrettably misdesigned, the core SDL library seems to cover
	all we could possibly want for Shuusou Gyoku, including a 2D renderer… wait,
	<i>what</i>?!
</p><p>
	Yup. Admittedly, I've been living under a rock as far as SDL is concerned,
	and thus wasn't aware that SDL 2 introduced <a
	href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_Renderer">its own abstraction for 2D
	rendering</a> that just happens to almost exactly cover everything we need
	for Shuusou Gyoku. This API even covers all of the game's Direct3D code,
	which only draws alpha-blended, untextured, and pre-transformed
	vertex-colored triangles and lines. It's the exact abstraction over OpenGL I
	thought I had to write myself, and such a perfect match for this game that
	it would be foolish to go for a custom OpenGL backend – especially since SDL
	will automatically target the ideal graphics API for any given operating
	system.
</p><p>
	Sadly, the one thing SDL_Renderer is missing is something equivalent to
	pixel shaders, which we would need to replicate the <span lang="ja">西方
	Ｐｒｏｊｅｃｔ</span> lens ball effect shown at startup. Looks like we have
	to drop into <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_GetWindowSurface">a
	completely separate, unaccelerated rendering mode</a> and continue to
	software-render this one effect before switching to hardware-accelerated
	rendering for the rest of the game. But at least we <i>can</i> do that in a
	cross-platform way, and <i>don't</i> have to bother with shading languages –
	or, perhaps even worse, <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">SDL's own shading
	language</a>.<br />
	If we were extremely pedantic, we'd also have to do the same for the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-12-31" "unused spiral effect that was originally intended for the staff roll"}}.
	Software rendering would be even more annoying there, since we don't
	<i>just</i> have to software-render these staff sprites, but also the ending
	picture and text, complete with their respective fade effects. And while I
	typically do go the extra mile to preserve whatever code was present in
	these games, keeping <i>this</i> effect would just needlessly drive up the
	cost of the SDL backend. Let's just move this one to the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/tree/master/unused">museum of unused
	code</a> and no longer actively compile it. RIP spiral 🥲 At least you're
	still preserved in lossless video form.
</p><p>
	Now that SDL has become an integral part of Shuusou Gyoku's portability plan
	rather than just being one potential platform layer among many, the optimal
	order of tasks has slightly changed. If we stayed within the raw Win32 API
	any longer than absolutely necessary, we'd only risk writing  more
	Win32-native code for things like <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/9">audio streaming</a> that we'd
	then have to throw away and rewrite in SDL later. Next up, therefore:
	Staying with Shuusou Gyoku, but continuing in a much more focused manner by
	fixing the input system and starting the SDL migration with input and sound.
</p>
