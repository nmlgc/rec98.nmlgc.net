<p>
	Back after taking way too long to get {{DB_CustomerByID 9}}'s MediaWiki
	update feature completeâ€¦ I'm still waiting for more translators to test and
	review the new translation interface before delivering and deploying it
	all, which will most likely lead to another break from ReC98 within the
	next few months. For now though, I'm happy to have mostly addressed the
	nagging responsibility I still had after willing that site into existence,
	and to be back working on ReC98. ðŸ™‚
</p><p>
	As announced, the next few pushes will focus on TH04's and TH05's bullet
	spawning code, before I get to put all that accumulated TH01 money towards
	finishing all of {{HTML_TagInline "konngara"}}'s code in TH01. For a full
	picture of what's happening with bullets, we'd <i>really</i> also like to
	have the bullet update function as readable C code though.<br />
	Clearing all bullets on the playfield will trigger a <i>Bonus!!</i> popup,
	displayed as {{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-16" "gaiji"}} in that proportional
	font. Unfortunately, TLINK refused to link the code as soon as I referenced
	the function for animating the popups at the top of the playfield? Which
	can only mean that we have to decompile that function firstâ€¦
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><p>
	So, let's turn that piece of technical debt into a full push, and first
	decompile another random set of previously reverse-engineered TH04 and TH05
	functions. Most of these are stored in a different place within the two
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code> binaries, and the tried-and-true method of matching
	segment names would therefore have introduced several unnecessary
	translation units. So I resorted to a segment splitting technique I should
	have started using way earlier: Simply creating new segments with names
	derived from their functions, at the exact positions they're needed. All
	the new segment start and end directives do bloat the ASM code somewhat,
	and certainly contributed to this push barely removing any actual lines of
	code. However, what we get in return is total freedom as far as
	decompilation order is concerned,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-16" "which should be the case for any ReC project, really"}}.
	And in the end, all these tiny code segments will cancel out anyway.<br />
	If only we could do the same with the data segmentâ€¦
</p><hr /><p>
	The popup function happened to be the final one I RE'd before my long break
	in the spring of 2019. Back then, I didn't even bother looking into that
	64-frame delay between changing popups, and what that meant for the game.
	<br />
	Each of these popups stays on screen for 128 frames, during which, of
	course, another popup-worthy event might happen. Handling this cleanly
	without removing previous popups too early would involve some sort of event
	queue, whose size might even be meaningfully limited to the number of
	distinct events that can happen. But still, that'd be a data structure, and
	we're not gonna have <i>that</i>! {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Instead, ZUN
	simply keeps two variables for the new and current popup ID. During an
	active popup, any change to that ID will only be committed once the current
	popup has been shown for at least 64 frames. And during <i>that</i> time,
	that new ID can be freely overwritten with a different one, which drops any
	previous, undisplayed event. But surely, there won't be more than two
	events happening within 63 frames, right? {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	The rest was fairly uneventful â€“ no newly RE'd functions in this push,
	after all â€“ until I reached the widely used helper function for applying
	the current vertical scrolling offset to a Y coordinate. Its combination of
	a function parameter, the <code>pascal</code> calling convention, and no
	stack frame was previously thought to be undecompilableâ€¦ except that it
	isn't, and the decompilation didn't even require any new workarounds to be
	developed? Good thing that I already forgot how impossible it was to
	decompile the first function I looked at that fell into this category!<br />
	Oh well, this discovery wasn't <i>too</i> groundbreaking. Looking back at
	all the other functions with that combination only revealed a grand total
	of 1 additional one where a decompilation made sense: TH05's version of
	<code>snd_kaja_interrupt()</code>, which is now compiled from the same C++
	file for all 4 games that use it. And well, looks like some quirks really
	remain unnoticed and undocumented until you look at a function for the 11th
	time: Its return value is undefined if BGM is inactive â€“ that is, if the
	user disabled it, or if no FM board is installed. Not that it matters for
	the original code, which never uses this function to retrieve anything from
	KAJA's drivers. But people apparently do copy ReC98 code into their own
	projects, so it <i>is</i> something to keep in mind.
</p><hr /><p>
	All in all, nothing quite at {{HTML_TagInline "jank"}} level in this one, but we were surely <i>grazing</i> that tag. Next up, with that out of the way: The bullet update/step function! Very soon in fact, since I've mostly got it done already.
