	With no feedback to {{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-13" "last week's blog post"}},
	I assume you all are fine with how things are going? Alright then, another
	one towards position independence, with the same approach as before…
<p>
	Since {{DB_CustomerByID 2}} wanted to learn something about how the PC-98
	EGC is used in TH04 and TH05, I took a look at master.lib's <code>
	egc_shift_*()</code> functions. These simply do a hardware-accelerated
	<code>memmove()</code> of any VRAM region, and are used for screen shaking
	effects. Hover over the image below for the raw effect:

href="{{$pic1}}"><img src="{{$pic1}}" onmouseover="this.setAttribute('src', {{$pic2}});" onmouseout="this.setAttribute('src', {{$pic1}});" alt="Demonstration of an egc_shift_left() call" /></a>
</p><p>
	Then, I finally wanted to take a look at the bullet structures, but it
	required <i>way</i> too much reverse-engineering to even start within ¾ of
	a position independence push. Even <i>with</i> the help of uth05win –
	bullet handling was changed quite a bit from TH04 to TH05.
</p><p>
	What I ultimately settled on was more raw, "boring" PI work based around
	an already known set of functions. For this one, I looked at vector
	construction… and this time, that actually <i>made</i> the games a little
	bit more position-independent, and <i>wasn't</i> just all about removing
	false positives from the calculation. This was one of the few sets of
	functions that would also apply to TH01, and it revealed just how
	chaotically that game was coded. This one commit shows three ways how ZUN
	stored regular 2D points in TH01:
</p><ul>
	<li>"regularly", like in master.lib's <code>Point</code> structure (X
	first, Y second)</li>
	<li>reversed, (Y first and X second), then obviously with two distinct
	variables declared next to each other</li>
	<li>and with multiple points stored in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arrays">structure of arrays</a>.</li>
</ul><p>
	… yeah. But in more productive news, this <i>did</i> actually lay the
	groundwork for TH04 and TH05 bullet structures. Which might even be coming
	up within the next big, 5-push order from {{DB_CustomerByID 9}}? These are
	the	priorities I got from them, let's see how close I can get!
