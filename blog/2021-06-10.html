	Y'know, I kinda prefer the pending crowdfunded workload to stay more near
	the middle of the cap, rather than being sold out all the time. So to reach
	this point more quickly, let's do the most relaxing thing that can be
	easily done in TH05 right now: The boss backgrounds, starting with Shinki's,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-19" "now that we've got the time to look at it in detail"}}.
</p><p>
	â€¦ Oh <i>come on</i>, more things that are borderline undecompilable, and
	require new workarounds to be developed? Yup, Borland C++ always optimizes
	any comparison of a register with a literal 0 to <code>OR reg, reg</code>,
	no matter how many calculations and inlined function calls you replace the
	0 with. Shinki's background particle rendering function contains a
	<code>CMP AX, 0</code> instruction thoughâ€¦ so yeah,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-02-21" "yet another piece of custom ASM that's worse"}}
	than what Turbo C++ 4.0J would have generated if ZUN had just written
	readable C. This was probably motivated by ZUN insisting that his modified
	master.lib function for blitting particles takes its X and Y parameters as
	registers. If he had just used the <code>__fastcall</code> convention, he
	also would have got the sprite ID passed as a register. ðŸ¤·<br />
	So, we <i>really</i> don't want to be forced into inline assembly just
	because of the third comparison in the otherwise perfectly decompilable
	four-comparison <code>if()</code> expression that prevents invisible
	particles from being drawn. The workaround: Comparing to a <i>pointer</i>
	instead, which only the linker gets to resolve to the actual value of 0.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} This way, the compiler has to make room for
	any 16-bit literal, and can't optimize anything.
</p><hr /><p>
	And then we go straight from {{HTML_TagInline "micro-optimization"}} to
	{{HTML_TagInline "waste"}}, with all the duplication in the code that
	animates all those particles together with the zooming and spinning lines.
	This push decompiled 1.31% of all code in TH05, and thanks to alignment,
	we're still missing Shinki's high-level background rendering function that
	calls all the subfunctions I decompiled here.<br />
	With all the manipulated state involved here, it's not at all trivial to
	see how this code produces what you see in-game. Like:<ol>
	<li>If all lines have the same Y velocity, how do the other three lines in
	background type B get pushed down into this vertical formation while the
	top one stays still? (Answer: This velocity is only applied to the top
	line, the other lines are only pushed based on some delta.)</li>
	<li>How can this delta be calculated based on the distance of the top line
	with its supposed target point around Shinki's wings? (Answer: The velocity
	is never set to 0, so the top line overshoots this target point in every
	frame. After calculating the delta, the top line itself is pushed down as
	well, canceling out the movement. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}})</li>
	<li>Why don't they get pushed down infinitely, but stop eventually?
	(Answer: We only see four lines out of 20, at indices #0, #6, #12, and
	#18. In each frame, lines [0..17] are copied to lines [1..18], before
	anything gets moved. The invisible lines are pushed down based on the delta
	as well, which defines a distance between the visible lines of (velocity *
	array gap). And since the velocity is capped at -14 pixels per frame, this
	also means a maximum distance of 84 pixels between the midpoints of each
	line.)</li>
	<li>And why are the lines moving back up when switching to background type
	C, before moving down? (Answer: Because type C <i>increases</i> the
	velocity rather than decreasing it. Therefore, it relies on the previous
	velocity state from type B to show a gapless animation.)</li>
</ol><p>
	So yeah, it's a nice-looking effect, just <i>very</i> hard to understand. ðŸ˜µ
</p><p>
	With the amount of effort I'm putting into this project, I typically
	gravitate towards more descriptive function names. Here, however,
	uth05win's simple and seemingly tiny-brained "background type A/B/C/D" was
	quite a smart choice. It clearly defines the sequence in which these
	animations are intended to be shown, and as we've seen with point 4
	from the list above, that does indeed matter.
</p><p>
	Next up: At least EX-Alice's background animations, and probably also the
	high-level parts of the background rendering for all the other TH05 bosses.
