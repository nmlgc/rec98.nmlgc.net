	Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/handlerug">handlerug</a> for
	implementing and PR'ing the feature in a very clean way. That makes at least
	two people I know who wanted to see feed support, so there are probably
	a few more out there.
</p><hr /><p>
	So, Shuusou Gyoku. pbg released the original source code for the first two
	Seihou games back in February 2019, but notably removed the crucial
	decompression code for the original packfiles due to… various unspecified
	reasons, considerations, and implications. {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} This vague
	language and subsequent <a
	href="https://github.com/pbghogehoge/ssg/pull/1">rejection of a pull request
	to add these features back in</a> were probably the main reasons why no one
	has publicly done anything with this codebase since.
</p><p>
	The only other fork I know about is <a
	href="https://github.com/Priw8">Priw8</a>'s private fork from 2020, but only
	because <a
	href="https://twitter.com/WishMakers_TH/status/1520633977756786688">WishMakers
	informed me about it</a> shortly after this push was funded. Both of them
	might also contribute some features to my fork in the future if their time
	allows it.<br />
	In this fork, Priw8 replaced packfile decompression with raw reads from
	directories with the pre-extracted contents of all the .DAT files. This
	works for playing the game, but there are actually two more things that
	require the original packfile code:
</p><ul>
	<li>High scores are stored as a bitstream with every variable separated by
	an alternating 0 or 1 bit, using the same bit-level access functions as the
	packfile reader. That's a quite… unique form of obfuscation: It requires way
	too much code to read and write the format, and doesn't even obfuscate the
	data <i>that</i> well because you can still see clear patterns when opening
	these scorefiles in a hex editor.</li>
	<li>Replays are 2-"file" archives compressed using the same algorithm as the
	packfile. The first "file" contains metadata like the shot type, stage, and
	RNG seed, and the second one contains the input state for every frame.</li>
</ul><p>
	We can surely implement our own simple and uncompressed formats for these
	things, but it's not the idea to build all future Shuusou Gyoku features on
	top of a replay-incompatible fork. So, what do we do? On the one hand, pbg
	expressed the clear wish to not include data reverse-engineered from the
	original binary. On the other hand, he released the code under the MIT
	license, which allows us to modify the code and distribute the results in
	any way we wish.<br />
	So, let's meet in the middle, and go for a clean-room implementation of the
	missing features as indicated by their usage, without looking at either the
	original binary or wangqr's reverse-engineered code.
</p><hr /><p>
	With incremental rebuilds being broken in the latest Visual Studio project
	files as well, it made sense to start from scratch on pbg's last commit. Of
	course, I can't pass up a chance to use
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-03" "Tup, my favorite build system"}} for every
	project I'm the main developer of. It might not fit Shuusou Gyoku as well as
	it fits ReC98, but let's see whether it would be reasonable at all…
</p><p>
	… and it's actually not too bad! Modern Visual Studio makes this a bit
	harder than it should be with all the intermediate build artifacts you have
	to keep track of. In the end though, it's still only <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/5c163b6adf746289bf80e449752da888cea09a97/Tuprules.lua">70
	lines of Lua to have a nice abstraction for both Debug and Release
	builds</a>. With this layer underneath, the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/5c163b6adf746289bf80e449752da888cea09a97/Tupfile.lua">actual
	Shuusou Gyoku-specific part</a> can be expressed as succinctly as in any
	other modern build system, while still making every compiler flag explicit.
	It might be slightly slower than a traditional <code>.vcxproj</code> build
	due to <a
	href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/make-vc-compiles-fast-through-parallel-compilation/">launching
	one <code>cl.exe</code> process per translation unit</a>, but the result is
	way more reliable and trustworthy compared to anything that involves Visual
	Studio project files. This simplicity paves the way for expanding the build
	process to multiple steps, and doing all the static checking on translation
	strings that I never got to do for thcrap-based patches. Heck, I might even
	compile all future translations directly into the binary…
</p><p>
	Every C++ build system will invariably be hated by <i>someone</i>, so I'd
	say that your goal should always be to simplify the actually important parts
	of your build enough to allow everyone else to easily adapt it to their
	favorite system. This Tupfile definitely does a better job there than your
	average <code>.vcxproj</code> file – but if you still want such a thing (or,
	gasp, 🤮&nbsp;CMake project files&nbsp;🤮) for better Visual Studio IDE
	integration, you should have no problem generating them for yourself.<br />
	There might still be a point in doing that because that's the one part that
	unfortunately sucks about this approach. Visual Studio is horribly broken
	for any nonstandard C++ project even in 2022:
</p><ul>
	<li>Makefile projects can be nicely integrated with Debug and Release
	configurations, but setting a later C++ language standard requires <a
	href="https://github.com/Microsoft/VSLinux/issues/292#issuecomment-696271764">dumb
	<code>.vcxproj</code> hacks</a> that don't even work properly anymore.</li>
	<li>Folder projects are ridiculously ugly: The Build toolbar is permanently
	grayed out <i>even if you configured a build task</i>. For some reason,
	configuring these tasks merely adds one additional element to a 9-element
	context menu in the Solution Explorer. Also, why does the big IDE use a
	different JSON schema than the perfectly functional and adequate one from
	Visual Studio Code?</li>
</ul>
	In both cases, IntelliSense doesn't work properly <i>at all</i> even if it
	appears to be configured correctly, and Tup's dependency tracking appeared
	to be weirdly cut off for the very final .PDB file. Interestingly though,
	using the big Visual Studio IDE for just <i>debugging</i> a binary via
	<code>devenv bin/GIAN07.exe</code> suddenly eliminates all the IntelliSense
	issues. Looks like there's a lot of essential information stored in the .PDB
	files that Visual Studio just refuses to read in any other context.
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><p>
	But now compare that to Visual Studio Code: Open it from the <i>x64_x86
	Cross Tools Command Prompt</i> via <code>code .</code>,  launch a build or
	debug task, or browse the code with perfect IntelliSense. Three small
	configuration files and everything just works – heck, you even get the Tup
	progress bar in the terminal. It might be Electron bloatware and horribly
	slow at times, but Visual Studio Code has long outperformed regular Visual
	Studio in terms of non-debug functionality.
</p><hr /><p>
	On to the compression algorithm then… and it's just textbook <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski">LZSS</a>,
	with 13 bits for the offset of a back-reference and 4 bits for its length?
	Hardly a trade secret there. The hard parts there all come from unexpected
	inefficiencies in the bitstream format:
</p><ol>
	<li>Encoding back-references as offsets into an 8 KiB ring buffer dictionary
	means that the most straightforward implementation actually needs an 8 KiB
	array for the LZSS sliding window. This could have easily been done with
	zero additional memory if the offset was encoded as the difference to the
	current byte instead.</li>
	<li>The packfile format stores the uncompressed size of every file in its
	header, which is a good thing because you want to know in advance how much
	heap memory to allocate for a specific file. Nevertheless, the original game
	only stops reading bits from the packfile once it encountered a
	back-reference with an offset of 0. This means that the compressor not only
	has to write this technically unneeded back-reference to the end of the
	compressed bitstream, but also ignore any potential other longest
	back-reference with an offset of 0 <i>within</i> the file. The latter can
	easily happen with a ring buffer dictionary.</li>
</ol><p>
	The original game used a single <code>BIT_DEVICE</code> class with mode
	flags for every combination of reading and writing memory buffers and
	on-disk files. Since that would have necessitated a lot of error checking
	for all (pseudo-)methods of this class, I wrote one dedicated small class
	for each one of these permutations instead. To further emphasize the
	clean-room property of this code, these use modern C++ memory ownership
	features: <code>std::unique_ptr</code> for the fixed-size read-only buffers
	we get from packfiles, <code>std::vector</code> for the newly compressed
	buffers where we don't know the size in advance, and <code>std::span</code>
	for a borrowed reference to an immutable region of memory that we want to
	treat as a bitstream. Definitely better than using the native Win32
	<code>LocalAlloc()</code> and <code>LocalFree()</code> allocator, especially
	if we want to port the game away from Windows one day.
</p><p>
	One feature I didn't use though: C++ fstreams, because those are trash.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} These days, they would seem to be the natural
	choice with the new <code>std::filesystem::path</code> type from C++17:
	Correctly constructed, you can pass that type to an fstream constructor and
	gain both locale independence on Windows <i>and</i> portability to
	everything else, without writing any Windows-specific UTF-16 code. But even
	in a Release build, fstreams add ~100 KB of locale-related bloat to the .EXE
	which adds no value for just reading binary files. That's just too
	embarrassing if you look at how much space the rest of the game takes up.
	Writing your own platform layer that calls the Win32
	<code>CreateFileW()</code>, <code>ReadFile()</code>, and
	<code>WriteFile()</code> API functions is apparently still the way to go
	even in 2022. And with <code>std::filesystem::path</code> still being a
	welcome addition to C++, it's not too much code to write either.
</p><p>
	This gets us file format compatibility with the original release… and a
	crash as soon as the ending starts, but only in Release mode? As it turns
	out, this crash is caused by <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/commit/5c163b6adf746289bf80e449752da888cea09a97">an
	out-of-bounds</a> <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/5c163b6adf746289bf80e449752da888cea09a97/GIAN07/ENDING.CPP#L127-L128">array
	access bug</a> that was present even in the original game, and only turned
	into a crash now because the optimizer in modern Visual Studio versions
	reorders static data. As a result, the 6-element <code>pFontInfo</code>
	array got placed in front of an ECL-related counter variable that then got
	corrupted by the write to the 7<sup>th</sup> element, which  subsequently
	crashed the game with a read access to previously deallocated danmaku script
	data. That just goes to show that these <i>technical</i> bugs are important
	and worth fixing even if they don't cause issues in the original game. Who
	knows how many of these will turn into crashes once we get to porting PC-98
	Touhou?
</p><hr /><p>
	So here we go, a new build of Shuusou Gyoku, compiled with Visual Studio
	2022, and compatible with all original data formats:
</p><p>
	<a class="release"
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/releases/tag/P0217"
	><strong>{{HTML_Emoji "sh01"}} Shuusou Gyoku P0217</strong></a>
</p><p>
	Inside the regular Shuusou Gyoku installation directory, this binary works
	as a full-fledged drop-in replacement for the original
	<code>秋霜玉.exe</code>. It still has all of the original binary's problems
	though:
</p><ul>
	<li>Separate Japanese locale emulation is still needed to correctly refer to
	the original names of the configuration (<code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>), score
	(<code>秋霜SC.DAT</code>), and replay (<code>秋霜りぷ*.DAT</code>) files.
	It's also required for the ending text to not render as mojibake.</li>
	<li>Running the game at full speed and without graphical glitches on modern
	Windows still requires a separate DirectDraw patch such as <a
	href="https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/releases">DDrawCompat</a>. To
	eliminate any remaining flickering, configure the game to use 16-bit
	graphics in the <i>Config → Graphic</i> menu.</li>
</ul><p>
	As well as some of its own:
</p><ul>
	<li>The original screenshot feature is still missing, as it also wasn't part
	of pbg's released source code.</li>
	<li>If you're wondering why your antivirus is freaking out: I explained the
	reasons in <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/22">this GitHub
	issue</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/21">some more
	background here</a>.</li>
</ul><p>
	So all in all, it's a strict downgrade at this point in time.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} And more of a symbol that we can now start
	doing actual work on this game. Seihou has been a fun change of pace, and I
	hope that I get to do more work on the series. There is quite a lot to be
	done with Shuusou Gyoku alone, and the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues">21 GitHub issues</a> I've opened
	are probably only scratching the surface.<br />
	However, all the required research for this one consumed more like 1⅔
	pushes. Despite just one push being funded, it wouldn't have made sense to
	release the commits or this binary in any earlier state. To repay this debt,
	I'm going to put the next {{HTML_Currency 5000}} for Seihou towards the
	small code maintenance and performance tasks that I usually do for free,
	before doing any more feature and bugfix work. Next up: Improving video
	playback on the blog, and maybe delivering some microtransaction work on the
	side?
