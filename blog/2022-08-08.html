<p>
	Whew, TH01's boss code just had to end with another beast of a boss, taking
	way longer than it should have and leaving uncomfortably little time for the
	rest of the game. Let's get right into the overview of YuugenMagan, the most
	sequential and scripted battle in this game:
</p><ul>
	<li>The fight consists of 14 phases, numbered (of course) from 0 to 13.
	Unlike all other bosses, the "entrance phase" 0 is a proper gameplay-enabled
	part of the fight itself, which is why I also count it here.</li>
	<li>YuugenMagan starts with 16 HP, second only to Sariel's 18+6. The HP bar
	visualizes the HP threshold for the end of phases 3 (white part) and 7
	(red-white part), respectively.</li>
	<li>All even-numbered phases change the color of the 邪 kanji in the stage
	background, and don't check for collisions between the Orb and any eye.
	Almost all of them consequently don't feature an attack, except for phase
	0's 1-pixel lasers, spawning symmetrically from the left and right edges of
	the playfield towards the center. Which means that yes, YuugenMagan is in
	fact invincible during this first attack.</li>
	<li>All other attacks are part of the odd-numbered phases:<ul>
		<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Slow pellets from the lateral eyes. Ends
		at 15 HP.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Missiles from the southern eyes, whose
		angles first shift away from Reimu's tracked position and then towards
		it. Ends at 12 HP.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Circular pellets sprayed from the lateral
		eyes. Ends at 10 HP.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 7:</strong> Another missile pattern, but this time
		with both eyes shifting their missile angles by the same
		(counter-)clockwise delta angles. Ends at 8 HP.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 9:</strong> The 3-pixel 3-laser sequence from the
		northern eye. Ends at 2 HP.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 11:</strong> Spawns the pentagram with one corner out
		of every eye, then gradually shrinks and moves it towards the center of
		the playfield. Not really an "attack" (surprise) as the pentagram can't
		reach the player during this phase, but collision detection is
		technically already active here. Ends at 0 HP, marking the earliest
		point where the fight itself can possibly end.</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 13:</strong> Runs through the parallel "pentagram
		attack phases". The first five consist of the pentagram alternating its
		spinning direction between clockwise and counterclockwise while firing
		pellets from each of the five star corners. After that, the pentagram
		slams itself into the player, before YuugenMagan <i>loops back to phase
		10</i> to spawn a new pentagram. On the next run through phase 13, the
		pentagram grows larger and immediately slams itself into the player,
		before starting a new pentagram attack phase cycle with another loop
		back to phase 10.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Since the HP bar fills up in a phase with no collision detection,
	YuugenMagan is immune to
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "test/debug mode heap corruption"}}. It's
	generally impossible to get YuugenMagan's HP into negative numbers, with
	collision detection being disabled every other phase, and all odd-numbered
	phases ending immediately upon reaching their HP threshold.</li>
	<li>All phases until the very last one have a timeout condition, independent
	from YuugenMagan's current HP:<ul>
		<li><strong>Phase 0:</strong> 331 frames</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> 1101 frames</li>
		<li><strong>Phases 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12:</strong> 70 frames each</li>
		<li><strong>Phases 3 and 7:</strong> 5 iterations of the pattern, or
		1845 frames each</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> 5 iterations of the pattern, or 2230
		frames</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 9:</strong> The full duration of the sequence, or 491
		frames</li>
		<li><strong>Phase 11:</strong> Until the pentagram reached its target
		position, or 221 frames</li>
	</ul>
	This makes it possible to reach phase 13 without dealing a single point of
	damage to YuugenMagan, after almost exactly 2½ minutes on any difficulty.
	Your actual time will certainly be higher though, as you <i>will</i> have to
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> at least once during the attempt.
	And let's be real, you're <i>very</i> likely to subsequently lose a
	life.</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	At a pixel-perfect 81×61 pixels, the Orb hitboxes are laid out rather
	generously this time, reaching quite a bit outside the 64×48 eye sprites:
</p><figure>
	<img src="{{$pic_hitbox}}" alt="TH01 YuugenMagan's hitboxes."/>
</figure><p>
	And that's about the only positive thing I can say about a position
	calculation in this fight. Phase 0 already starts with the lasers being off
	by 1 pixel from the center of the iris. Sure, 28 may be a nicer number to
	add than 29, but the result won't be byte-aligned either way? This is
	followed by the eastern laser's hitbox somehow being 24 pixels larger than
	the others, stretching a rather unexpected 70 pixels compared to the 46 of
	every other laser.<br />
	On a more hilarious note, the eye closing keyframe contains the following
	(pseudo-)code, comprising the only real accidentally "unused" danmaku
	subpattern in TH01:
</p><pre>// Did you mean ">= RANK_HARD"?
if(rank == RANK_HARD) {
	eye_north.fire_aimed_wide_5_spread();
	eye_southeast.fire_aimed_wide_5_spread();
	eye_southwest.fire_aimed_wide_5_spread();

	// Because this condition can never be true otherwise.
	// As a result, no pellets will be spawned on Lunatic mode.
	// (There is another Lunatic-exclusive subpattern later, though.)
	if(rank == RANK_LUNATIC) {
		eye_west.fire_aimed_wide_5_spread();
		eye_east.fire_aimed_wide_5_spread();
	}
}</pre>
</p><figure {{$vid_p0_h.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_p0_h $vid_p0_l $vid_p0_u.FlipActive}}
	<figcaption>
		Featuring the weirdly extended hitbox for the eastern laser, as well as
		an initial Reimu position that points out the disparity between
		byte-aligned rendering and the internal coordinates one final time.
	</figcaption>
</figure><hr /><p>
	After a few utility functions that look more like a quickly abandoned
	refactoring attempt, we quickly get to the main attraction: YuugenMagan
	combines the entire boss script and most of the pattern code into a single
	2,634-instruction function, totaling 9,677 bytes inside
	<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>. For comparison, ReC98's version of this code
	consists of at least 49 functions, excluding those I had to add to work
	around ZUN's little inconsistencies, or the ones I added for stylistic
	reasons.<br />
	In fact, this function is so large that Turbo C++ 4.0J refuses to generate
	assembly output for it via the <code>-S</code> command-line option, aborting
	with a <code>Compiler table limit exceeded in function</code> error.
	Contrary to what the <i>Borland C++ 4.0 User Guide</i> suggests, this
	instance of the error is not at all related to the number of function bodies
	or any metric of algorithmic complexity, but is simply a result of the
	compiler's internal text representation for a single function overflowing a
	64 KiB memory segment. Merely shortening the names of enough identifiers
	within the function can help to get that representation down below 64 KiB.
	If you encounter this error during regular software development, you might
	interpret it as the compiler's roundabout way of telling you that it inlined
	way more function calls than you probably wanted to have inlined. Because
	<i>you</i> definitely <i>won't</i> explicitly spell out such a long function
	in newly-written code, right?
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	At least it wasn't the worst copy-pasting job in this
	game; that trophy still goes to {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "Elis"}}. And
	while the tracking code for adjusting an eye's sprite according to the
	player's relative position is one of the main causes behind all the bloat,
	it's also 100% consistent, and might have been an inlined class method in
	ZUN's original code as well.
</p><p>
	The clear highlight in this fight though? <i>Almost no coordinate is
	precisely calculated where you'd expect it to be.</i> In particular, all
	bullet spawn positions completely ignore the direction the eyes are facing
	to:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<img src="{{$pic_coord_0}}" alt="Pellets unexpectedly spawned at the exact
	bottom center of an eye" />
	<figcaption>Combining the bottom of the pupil with the exact horizontal
	center of the sprite as a whole might sound like a good idea, but looks
	especially wrong if the eye is facing right.</figcaption>
</figure><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<img src="{{$pic_coord_1}}" alt="Missile spawn positions in the TH01

	<figcaption>Here it's the other way round: OK for a right-facing eye, really
	wrong for a left-facing one.</figcaption>
</figure><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<img src="{{$pic_coord_2}}" alt="Spawn position of the 3-pixel laser in the

	<figcaption>Dude, the eye is even <i>supposed</i> to track the laser in this
	one!</figcaption>
</figure><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<img src="{{$pic_coord_3}}" alt="The final center position of the regular
	pentagram in the TH01 YuugenMagan fight" />
	<figcaption>Hint: That's not the center of the playfield. At least the
	pellets spawned from the corners are sort of correct, but with the corner
	calculates precomputed, you could only get them wrong on
	purpose.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Due to their effect on gameplay, these inaccuracies can't even be called
	"bugs", and made me devise a new "quirk" category instead. More on that in
	the TH01 100% blog post, though.
</p><hr /><p>
	While we did see an <i>accidentally</i> unused bullet pattern earlier, I can
	now say with certainty that there are no <i>truly</i> unused danmaku
	patterns in TH01, i.e., pattern code that exists but is never called.
	However, the code for YuugenMagan's phase 5 reveals another small piece of
	danmaku design <i>intention</i> that never shows up within the parameters of
	the original game.<br />
	By default, pellets are clipped when they fly past the top of the playfield,
	which we can clearly observe for the first few pellets of this pattern.
	Interestingly though, the second subpattern actually configures its pellets
	to fall straight down from the top of the playfield instead. You never see
	this happening in-game because ZUN limited that subpattern to a downwards
	angle range of <code>0x73</code> or 162°, resulting in none of its pellets
	ever getting close to the top of the playfield. If we extend that range to a
	full 360° though, we can see how ZUN might have originally planned the
	pattern to end:
</p><figure {{$vid_p5_e.FigureAttrs}}>

	<figcaption>YuugenMagan's phase 5 patterns on every difficulty, with the
	second subpattern extended to reveal the different pellet behavior that
	remained in the final game code. In the original game, the eyes would stop
	spawning bullets on the marked frame.</figcaption>
</figure><hr /><p>
	If we also disregard everything else about YuugenMagan that fits the
	upcoming definition of <i>quirk</i>, we're left with 6 "fixable" bugs, all
	of which are a symptom of general blitting and unblitting laziness. Funnily
	enough, they can all be demonstrated within a short 9-second part of the
	fight, from the end of phase 9 up until the pentagram starts spinning in
	phase 13:
</p><figure>{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_blit}}</figure><ol>
	<li>General flickering whenever any sprite overlaps an eye. This is caused
	by only reblitting each eye every 3 frames, and is an issue all throughout
	the fight. You might have already spotted it in the videos above.</li>
	<li>Each of the two lasers is unblitted and blitted individually instead of
	each operation being done for both lasers together. Remember how
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "ZUN unblits 32 horizontal pixels for every row of a line regardless of its width"}}?
	That's why the top part of the left, right-moving laser is never visible,
	because it's blitted before the other laser is unblitted.</li>
	<li>ZUN forgot to unblit the lasers when phase 9 ends. This footage was
	recorded by pressing ↵&nbsp;Return in test mode (<code>game t</code> or
	<code>game d</code>), and it's probably impossible to achieve this during
	actual gameplay without TAS techniques. You would have to deal the required
	6 points of damage within 491 frames, with the eye being invincible during
	240 of them. Simply shooting up an Orb with a horizontal velocity of 0 would
	also only work a single time, as boss entities always repel the Orb with a
	horizontal velocity of ±4.</li>
	<li>The shrinking pentagram is unblitted after the eyes were blitted,
	adding another guaranteed frame of flicker on top of the ones in 1). Like in
	2), the blockiness of the holes is another result of unblitting 32 pixels
	per row at a time.</li>
	<li>Another missing unblitting call in a phase transition, as the pentagram
	switches from its not quite correctly interpolated shrunk form to a regular
	star polygon with a radius of 64 pixels. Indirectly caused by the massively
	bloated coordinate calculation for the shrink animation being done
	separately for the unblitting and blitting calls. Instead of, y'know, just
	doing it once and storing the result in variables that can later be
	reused.</li>
	<li>The pentagram is not reblitted at all during the first 100 frames of
	phase 13</a>. During that rather long time, it's easily possible to remove
	it from VRAM completely by covering its area with player shots. Or <span
	style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> pellets.</li>
</ol><p>
	Definitely an appropriate end for this game's entity blitting code.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} I'm <i>really</i> looking forward to writing a
	proper sprite system for the Anniversary Edition…
</p><p>
	And just in case you were wondering about the hitboxes of these pentagrams
	as they slam themselves into Reimu:
</p><figure>{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_p}}</figure><p>
	62 pixels on the X axis, centered around each corner point of the star, 16
	pixels below, and extending infinitely far up. The latter part becomes
	especially devious because the game <i>always</i> collision-detects
	<i>all</i> 5 corners, regardless of whether they've already clipped through
	the bottom of the playfield. The simultaneously occurring shape distortions
	are simply a result of the line drawing function's rather poor
	re-interpolation of any line that runs past the 640×400 VRAM boundaries;
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "I described that in detail back when I debugged the shootout laser crash"}}.
	Ironically, using fixed-size hitboxes for a variable-sized pentagram means
	that the larger one is easier to dodge.
</p><hr /><p>
	The final puzzle in TH01's boss code comes
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-17" "once again"}} in the form of weird hardware
	palette changes. The <span class="ja">邪</span> kanji on the background
	image goes through various colors throughout the fight, which ZUN
	implemented by gradually incrementing and decrementing either a single one
	or none of the color's three 4-bit components at the beginning of each
	even-numbered phase. The resulting color sequence, however, doesn't
	<i>quite</i> seem to follow these simple rules:
</p><ul>
	{{- define "邪" -}}
		<code>{{.}}</code>
		<strong lang="ja" style="
			background: linear-gradient(135deg, #600 0%, #018 100%);
			padding: 0.25em;
			border-radius: 0.25em;
			color: {{.}};
			line-height: 2em;
		">邪</strong>
	{{- end -}}
	<li><strong>Phase 0</strong>: {{template "邪" "#DD5"}}</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: {{template "邪" "#0DF"}}</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: {{template "邪" "#F0F"}}</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 6</strong>: {{template "邪" "#00F"}}, but at the
	<i>end</i> of the phase?!</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 8</strong>: {{template "邪" "#0FF"}}, at the <i>start</i>
	of the phase, {{template "邪" "#0F5"}}, at the <i>end</i>!?</li>
	<li><strong>Phase 10</strong>: {{template "邪" "#FF5"}}, at the start of
	the phase, {{template "邪" "#F05"}}, at the end</li>
	<li><strong>Second repetition of phase 12</strong>: {{template "邪" "#005"}}
	shortly after the start of the phase?! {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}</li>
</ul><p>
	Adding some debug output sheds light on what's going on there:
</p><figure {{$vid_邪.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_邪}}
	<figcaption>
		Since each iteration of phase 12 adds 63 to the red component, integer
		overflow will cause the color to infinitely alternate between dark-blue
		and red colors on every 2.03 iterations of the pentagram phase loop. The
		65th iteration will therefore be the first one with a dark-blue color
		for a third iteration in a row – just in case you manage to stall the
		fight for that long.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Yup, ZUN had so much trust in the color clamping done by his hardware
	palette functions that he did not clamp the increment operation on the
	<code>stage_palette</code> itself. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Therefore, the 邪
	colors and even the timing of their changes from Phase 6 onwards are
	"defined" by wildly incrementing color components beyond their intended
	domain, so much that even the underlying signed 8-bit integer ends up
	overflowing. Given that the decrement operation on the
	<code>stage_palette</code> <i>is</i> clamped though, this might be another
	one of those accidents that ZUN deliberately left in the game,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-10" "similar to the conclusion I reached with infinite bumper loops"}}.<br />
	But guess what, that's also the last time we're going to encounter this type
	of palette component domain quirk! Later games use master.lib's 8-bit
	palette system, which keeps the comfort of using a single byte per
	component, but shifts the actual hardware color into the top 4 bits, leaving
	the bottom 4 bits for added precision during fades.
</p><p>
	OK, but <i>now</i> we're done with TH01's bosses! 🎉That was the
	8<sup>th</sup> PC-98 Touhou boss in total, leaving 23 to go.
</p><hr /><p>
	With all the necessary research into these quirks going well into a fifth
	push, I spent the remaining time in that one with transferring most of the
	data between YuugenMagan and the upcoming rest of <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>
	into C land. This included the one piece of technical debt in TH01 we've
	been carrying around since March 2015, as well as the final piece of the
	ending sequence in <code>FUUIN.EXE</code>. Decompiling that executable's
	<code>main()</code> function in a meaningful way requires pretty much all
	remaining data from <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> to also be moved into C land,
	just in case you were wondering why we're stuck at 99.46% there.<br />
	On a more disappointing note, the static initialization code for the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-12" "5 boss entity slots"}} ultimately revealed why
	YuugenMagan's code is as bloated and redundant as it is: The 5 slots really
	are 5 distinct variables rather than a single 5-element array. That's why
	ZUN explicitly spells out all 5 eyes every time, because the array he could
	have just looped over simply didn't exist. 😕 And while these slot variables
	<i>are</i> stored in a contiguous area of memory that I could just have
	taken the address of and then indexed it as <i>if</i> it were an array, I
	didn't want to annoy future port authors with what would technically be
	out-of-bounds array accesses for purely stylistic reasons. At least it
	wasn't that big of a deal to rewrite all boss code to use these distinct
	variables, although I certainly had to get a bit creative with Elis.
</p><p>
	Next up: Finding out how many points we got in totle, and hoping that ZUN
	didn't hide more unexpected complexities in the remaining 45 functions of
	this game. If you have {{HTML_Currency 1000}} to spare, there are two ways
	in which that amount of money would help right now:
</p><ul>
	<li>I'm expecting another {{HTML_Currency 3000}} subscription transaction
	from Yanga before the 15th, which would leave {{HTML_Currency 1000}} to
	round out one final TH01 RE push. With that, there'd be a total of 5 left in
	the backlog, which should be enough to get the rest of this game done.</li>
	<li>I <i>really</i> need to address the performance and usability issues
	with all the small videos in this blog. Just look at the video immediately
	above, where I disabled the controls because they would cover the debug text
	at the bottom… <strong>Edit (2022-10-31):</strong>… which no longer is an
	issue with our {{Blog_PostLink "2022-10-31" "custom video player"}}.<br />
	I already reserved this month's anonymous {{HTML_Currency
	5000}} contribution for this work, so it would take another {{HTML_Currency
	1000}} to be turned into a full push.</li>
</ul>
