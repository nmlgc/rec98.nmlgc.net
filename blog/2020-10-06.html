	This time around, laser is {{Blog_PostLink "2018-12-16" "actually"}} not
	difficult, with TH01's shootout laser class being simple enough to nicely
	fit into a single push. All other stationary lasers (as used by
	YuugenMagan, for example) don't even use a class, and are simply treated
	as regular lines with collision detection.
</p><p>
	But of course, the shootout lasers also come with the typical share of
	TH01 jank we've all come to expect by now. This time, it already starts
	with the hardcoded sprite data:
</p><figure class="pixelated"><img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhgAAIAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAAAAAAALAAAAACAAAgAAAJtDI6pYerH2ktRTlDty3rxyzEXNlLdFJVQWmatC35oCKqIaLMvPsJx1ZNtaCjbyqgL8n7LIZCZ9AgdpxmyOcNSn9DqyredLowYrzQXdWpNXHX6RtyQ12E0Hf5m579tKXh8dWWGN1i2x3cXF+ZSAAA7"
	alt="TH01 shootout laser 'sprites'"
	style="height: 24px;"></figure
><p>
	A shootout laser can have a width from 1 to 8 pixels, so ZUN stored a
	separate 16×1 sprite with a line for each possible width (left-to-right).
	Then, he shifted all of these sprites 1 pixel to the right for all of the
	8 possible start positions within a planar VRAM byte (top-to-bottom).
	Because… doing that bit shift programmatically is <i>way</i> too
	expensive, so let's pre-shift at compile time, and use 16× the memory per
	sprite? {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br>
</p><p>
	Since a bunch of other sprite sheets need to be pre-shifted as well (this
	is the 5th one we've found so far), our sprite converter has a feature to
	automatically generate those pre-shifted variations. This way, we can
	abstract away that implementation detail and leave modders with .BMP files
	that still only contain a single version of each sprite. But, uh…, wait,
	in this sprite sheet, the second row for 1-pixel lasers is accidentally
	shifted right by one more pixel that it should have been?! Which means
	that
</p><ol>
	<li>we can't use the auto-preshift feature here, and have to store this
	weird-looking (and quite frankly, completely unnecessary) sprite sheet in
	its entirety</li>
	<li>ZUN did, at least during TH01's development, <i>not</i> have a sprite
	converter, and directly hardcoded these dot patterns in the C++ code
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}</li>
</ol><hr><p>
	The waste continues with the class itself. 69 bytes, with 22 bytes
	outright unused, and 11 not really necessary. As for actual innovations
	though, we've got
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-12" "another 32-bit fixed-point type"}}, this
	time <i>actually</i> using 8 bits for the fractional part. Therefore, the
	ray position is tracked to the 1/256th of a pixel, using the full
	precision of master.lib's 8-bit <i>sin()</i> and <i>cos()</i> lookup
	tables.<br>
	Unblitting is also remarkably efficient: It's only done once the laser
	stopped extending and started moving, and only for the exact pixels at the
	start of the ray that the laser traveled by in a single frame. If only the
	ray part was also rendered as efficiently – it's fully blitted every frame,
	right next to the collision detection for each row of the ray.
</p><hr><p>
	With a public interface of two functions (spawn, and update / collide /
	unblit / render), that's superficially all there is to lasers in this
	game. There's another (apparently inlined) function though, to both reset
	and, uh, "fully unblit" all lasers at the end of every boss fight… except
	that it fails hilariously at doing the latter, and ends up effectively
	unblitting random 32-pixel line segments, due to ZUN confusing both the
	coordinates and the parameter types for the line unblitting function.

	A while ago, I was asked about
	<a href="https://youtu.be/Al0KTB_0u4A?t=80">this crash that tends to
	happen when defeating Elis</a>. And while you can clearly see the random
	unblitted line segments that are missing from the sprites, I don't
	<i>quite</i> think we've found the cause for the crash, since the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-14" "line unblitting function used there"}}
	<i>does</i> clip its coordinates to the VRAM range.
