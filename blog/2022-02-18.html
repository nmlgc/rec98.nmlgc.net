	Been {{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-23" "a while"}} since we last looked at any of
	TH03's game code! But before that, we need to talk about Y coordinates.
</p><p>
	During TH03's <code>MAIN.EXE</code>, the PC-98 graphics GDC runs in its
	line-doubled 640×200 resolution, which gives the in-game portion its
	distinctive stretched low-res look. This lower resolution is a consequence
	of using {{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-06" "Promisence Soft's SPRITE16 driver"}}:
	Its performance simply stems from the fact that it expects sprites to be
	stored in the bottom half of VRAM, which allows them to be blitted using the
	same EGC-accelerated VRAM-to-VRAM copies we've seen again and again in all
	other games. Reducing the visible resolution also means that the sprites can
	be stored on both VRAM pages, allowing the game to still be double-buffered.
	If you force the graphics chip to run at 640×400, you can see them:

	Note that the text chip still displays its overlaid contents at 640×400,
	which means that TH03's in-game portion <i>technically</i> runs at two
	resolutions at the same time.
</p><p>
	But that means that any mention of a Y coordinate is ambiguous: Does it
	refer to undoubled VRAM pixels, or on-screen stretched pixels? Especially
	people who have known about the line doubling for years might almost expect
	technical blog posts on this game to use undoubled VRAM coordinates. So,
	let's introduce a new formatting convention for both on-screen
	640×{{HTML_Screen_Y 400}} and undoubled 640×{{HTML_200_Y 200}} coordinates,
	and always write out both to minimize the confusion.
</p><hr /><p>
	Alright, now what's <i>the thing</i> gonna be? The enemy structure is highly
	overloaded, being used for enemies, fireballs, and explosions with seemingly
	different semantics for each. Maybe a bit too much to be figured out in what
	should ideally be a single push, especially with all the functions that
	would need to be decompiled? Bullet code would be easier, but not exactly
	single-push material either. As it turns out though, there's something more
	fundamental left to be done first, which both of these subsystems depend on:
	collision detection!
</p><p>
	And it's implemented exactly how I always naively imagined collision
	detection to be implemented in a fixed-resolution 2D bullet hell game with
	small hitboxes: By keeping a separate 1bpp bitmap of both playfields in
	memory, drawing in the collidable regions of all entities on every frame,
	and then checking whether any pixels at the current location of the player's
	hitbox are set to 1. It's probably not done in the other games because their
	single data segment was already too packed for the necessary 17,664 bytes to
	store such a bitmap at pixel resolution, and 282,624 bytes for a bitmap at
	Q12.4 subpixel resolution would have been prohibitively expensive in 16-bit
	Real Mode DOS anyway. In TH03, on the other hand, this bitmap is doubly
	useful, as the AI also uses it to elegantly learn what's on the playfield.
	By halving the resolution and only tracking tiles of 2×{{HTML_Screen_Y
	2}}&nbsp;/ 2×{{HTML_200_Y 1}} pixels, TH03 only requires an adequate total
	of 6,624 bytes of memory for the collision bitmaps of both playfields.
</p><p>
	So how did the implementation not earn the {{HTML_Tag "good-code" nil}} tag
	this time? Because the code for drawing into these bitmaps is undecompilable
	hand-written x86 assembly. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} And not just your usual
	ASM that was basically compiled from C and then edited to maybe optimize
	register allocation and maybe replace a bunch of local variables with
	self-modifying code, oh no. This code is full of overly clever bit
	twiddling, abusing the fact that the 16-bit <code>AX</code>,
	<code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> registers can also be
	accessed as two 8-bit registers, calculations that change the semantic
	meaning behind the value of a register, or just straight-up reassignments of
	different values to the same small set of registers. Sure, in some way it is
	impressive, and it all <i>does</i> work and correctly covers every edge
	case, but <i>come on</i>. This could have all been a lot more readable in
	exchange for just a few CPU cycles.
</p><p>
	What's most interesting though are the actual shapes that these functions
	draw into the collision bitmap. On the surface, we have:
</p><ol>
	<li>vertical slopes at any angle across the whole playfield; exclusively
	used for Chiyuri's diagonal laser EX attack</li>
	<li>straight vertical lines, with a width of 1 tile; exclusively used for
	the 2×{{HTML_Screen_Y 2}}&nbsp;/ 2×{{HTML_200_Y 1}} hitboxes of bullets</li>
	<li>rectangles at arbitrary sizes</li>
</ol><p>
	But only 2) actually draws a full solid line. 1) and 3) are only ever drawn
	as horizontal <i>stripes</i>, with a hardcoded distance of 2 vertical tiles
	between every stripe of a slope, and 4 vertical tiles between every stripe
	of a rectangle. That's 66-75% of each rectangular entity's intended hitbox
	not actually taking part in collision detection. Now, if player hitboxes
	were ≤ {{HTML_Screen_Y 6}}&nbsp;/ {{HTML_200_Y 3}} pixels, we'd have one
	possible explanation of how the AI can "cheat", because it could just
	precisely move through those blank regions at TAS speeds. So, let's make
	this two pushes after all and tell the complete story, since this is one of
	the more interesting aspects to still be documented in this game.
</p><hr /><p>
	And the code only gets worse. {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} While the player
	collision detection function <i>is</i> decompilable, it might as well not
	have been, because it's just more of the same "optimized", hard-to-follow
	assembly. With the four splittable 16-bit registers having a total of 20
	different meanings in this function, I would have almost <i>preferred</i>
	self-modifying code…
</p><p>
	In fact, it was so bad that it prompted some maintenance work on my inline
	assembly coding standards as a whole. Turns out that the <code>_asm</code>
	keyword is not only still supported in modern Visual Studio compilers, but
	also in Clang with the <code>-fms-extensions</code> flag, and compiles fine
	there even for 64-bit targets. While that might sound like amazing news at
	first <i>("awesome, no need to rewrite this stuff for my x86_64 Linux
	port!")</i>, you quickly realize that almost all inline assembly in this
	codebase assumes either PC-98 hardware, segmented 16-bit memory addressing,
	or is a temporary hack that will be removed with further RE progress.<br />
	That's mainly because most of the raw arithmetic code uses Turbo C++'s
	register pseudovariables where possible. While they certainly have their
	drawbacks, being a non-standard extension that's not supported in other
	x86-targeting C compilers, their advantages are quite significant: They
	allow this code to stay in the same language, and provide slightly more
	immediate portability to any other architecture, together with
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-03-20" "readability and maintainability improvements that can get quite significant when combined with inlining"}}:
</p><pre>// This one line compiles to five ASM instructions, which would need to be
// spelled out in any C compiler that doesn't support register pseudovariables.
// By adding typed aliases for these registers via `#define`, this code can be
// both made even more readable, and be prepared for an easier transformation
// into more portable local variables.
_ES = (((_AX * 4) + _BX) + SEG_PLANE_B);
</pre><p>
	However, register pseudovariables might cause potential portability issues
	as soon as they are mixed with inline assembly instructions that rely on
	their state. The lazy way of "supporting pseudo-registers" in other
	compilers would involve declaring the full set as global variables, which
	would immediately break every one of those instances:
</p><pre>_DI = 0;
_AX = 0xFFFF;

// Special x86 instruction doing the equivalent of
//
// 	*reinterpret_cast<uint16_t far *>(MK_FP(_ES, _DI)) = _AX;
// 	_DI += sizeof(uint16_t);
//
// Only generated by Turbo C++ in very specific cases, and therefore only
// reliably available through inline assembly.
asm { movsw; }
</pre><p>
	What's <i>also</i> not all too standardized, though, are certain variants of
	the <code>asm</code> keyword. That's why I've now introduced a distinction
	between the <code>_asm</code> keyword for "decently sane" inline assembly,
	and the slightly less standard <code>asm</code> keyword for inline assembly
	that relies on the contents of pseudo-registers, and <i>should</i> break on
	compilers that don't support them.<br /> So yeah, have some minor
	portability work in exchange for these two pushes not having all that much
	in RE'd content.
</p><p>
	With that out of the way and the function deciphered, we can confirm the
	player hitboxes to be a constant 8×{{HTML_Screen_Y 8}}&nbsp;/
	8×{{HTML_200_Y 4}} pixels, and prove that the hit stripes are nothing but
	an adequate optimization that doesn't affect gameplay in any way.
</p><hr /><p>
	And what's the obvious thing to immediately do if you have both the
	collision bitmap and the player hitbox? Writing a "real hitbox" mod, of
	course:
</p><ol>
	<li>Reorder the calls to rendering functions so that player and shot sprites
	are rendered after bullets</li>
	<li>Blank out all player sprite pixels outside an
	8×{{HTML_Screen_Y 8}}&nbsp;/ 8×{{HTML_200_Y 4}} box around the center
	point</li>
	<li>After the bullet rendering function, turn on the GRCG in RMW mode and
	set the tile register set to the background color</li>
	<li>Stretch the negated contents of collision bitmap onto each playfield,
	leaving only collidable pixels untouched</li>
	<li>Do the same with the actual, non-negated contents and a white color, for
	extra contrast against the background. This also makes sure to show any
	collidable areas whose sprite pixels are transparent, such as with the moon
	enemy. (Yeah, how unfair.) Doing that also loses a lot of information about
	the playfield, such as enemy HP indicated by their color, but what can you
	do:</li>

	The secret for writing such mods before having reached a sufficient level of
	position independence? Put your new code segment into <code>DGROUP</code>,
	past the end of the uninitialized data section. That's why this modded
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code> is a lot larger than you would expect from the raw amount of new code: The file now actually needs to <i>store</i> all these
	uninitialized 0 bytes between the end of the data segment and the first
	instruction of the mod code – normally, this number is simply a part of the
	MZ EXE header, and doesn't need to be redundantly stored on disk. Check the
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/th03_real_hitbox"><code>th03_real_hitbox</code></a>
	branch for the code.
</p><p>
	And now we know why so many "real hitbox" mods for the Windows Touhou games
	are inaccurate: The games would simply be unplayable otherwise – or can
	<i>you</i> dodge rapidly moving 2×{{HTML_Screen_Y 2}}&nbsp;/
	2×{{HTML_200_Y 1}} blocks as an 8×{{HTML_Screen_Y 8}}&nbsp;/
	8×{{HTML_200_Y 4}} rectangle that is smaller than your shot sprites,
	especially without focused movement? I can't. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
	Maybe it will feel more playable after making explosions visible, but that
	would need more RE groundwork first.<br
	/>
	It's also interesting how adding two full GRCG-accelerated redraws of both
	playfields per frame doesn't significantly drop the game's frame rate – so
	why did the drawing functions have to be micro-optimized again? It
	<i>would</i> be possible in one pass by using the GRCG's TDW mode, which
	should theoretically be 8× faster, but I have to stop <i>somewhere</i>.
