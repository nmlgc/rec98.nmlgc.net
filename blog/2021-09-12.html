	Yup, there still are features that can be fully covered in a single push
	and don't lead to sprawling blog posts. The giant
	<span style="color: red">STAGE number</span> and
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> messages, as well as the
	flashing transparent Êù±Êñπ‚òÖÈùàÁï∞‰ºù at the beginning of each scene are drawn
	by retrieving the glyphs for each letter from font ROM, and then "blitting"
	them to text RAM by placing a colored fullwidth 16√ó16 square at every pixel
	that is set in the font bitmap.<br />
	And {{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-31" "once again"}}, ZUN's code there matches
	the mediocre example code for the related hardware interrupt from the
	<i>PC-9801 Programmers' Bible</i>. It's not 100% copied this time, but
	definitely inspired by the code on page 121. Therefore, we can conclude
	that these letters are probably only displayed as these 16√ó scaled glyphs
	because that book had code on how to achieve this effect.
</p><p>
	ZUN "improved" on the example code by implementing a write-only cursor over
	the entire text RAM that fills every 16√ó16 cell with a differently colored
	space character, fully clearing the text RAM as a side effect. For once, he
	even removed some redundancy here by using helper functions! It's all still
	far from {{HTML_TagInline "good-code"}} though. For example, there's a
	function for filling 5 rows worth of cells, which he uses for both the top
	and bottom margin of these letters. But since the bottom margin starts at
	the 22nd line, the code writes past the 25th line and into the second TRAM
	page. Good that this page is not used by either the hardware or the game.
</p><p>
	These cursor functions can actually write any fullwidth JIS code point to
	text RAM‚Ä¶ and seem to do that in a rather simplified way, because shouldn't
	you set the most significant bit to indicate the right half of a fullwidth
	character? That's what's written in the same book that ZUN copied all
	functions out of, after all. ü§î Researching this led me down quite the
	rabbit hole, where I found an oddity in PC-98 text RAM rendering that no
	single one of the widely-used PC-98 emulators gets completely right. I'm
	<i>almost</i> done with the 2-push research into this issue, which will
	include fixes for DOSBox-X and Neko Project II. The only thing I'm missing
	to get these fully accurate is a screenshot of the output created by this binary, on any PC-98 model made by EPSON:
	{{HTML_Download .HostedPath $jist0x28}}
	That's the reason why this push was rather delayed. Thanks in advance to
	anyone	who'd like to help with this!
</p><hr /><p>
	In maybe more disappointing news: Sariel is going to be delayed for a while
	longer. üòï The player- and HUD-related functions, which previously delayed
	further progress there, turned out to call a lot of not yet RE'd functions
	themselves. Seems as if we're doing most of the
	{{HTML_TagInline "card-flipping"}} code second, after all? Next up: Point and bomb items, which at least are a significant step in terms of position
	independence.
