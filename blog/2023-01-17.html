	Starting the year with a delivery that <i>wasn't</i> delayed until the last
	day of the month for once, nice! Still, <q>very soon</q> and
	<q>high-maintenance</q> did <i>not</i> go well together…
</p><p>
	It definitely wasn't Sara's fault though. As you would expect from a Stage 1
	Boss, her code was no challenge at all. Most of the TH02, TH04, and TH05
	bosses follow the same overall structure, so let's introduce a new table to

	<li>In Phases 2 and 3, Sara cycles between waiting, moving randomly for a
	fixed 28 frames, and firing a random pattern among the 4 phase-specific
	ones. The pattern selection makes sure to <span class="hovertext"
	title="Since it's an infinite loop, a rogue RNG will cause the game to hang here, but that's a purely theoretical concern.">never</span>
	pick any pattern twice in a row. Both phases contain spiral patterns that
	only differ in the clockwise or counterclockwise turning direction of the
	spawner; these directions are treated as individual unrelated patterns, so
	it's possible for the "same" pattern to be fired multiple times in a row
	with a flipped direction.<br>
	The two phases also differ in the wait and pattern durations:
	<ul>
		<li>In Phase 2, the wait time starts at 64 frames and decreases by 12
		frames after the first 5 patterns each, ending on a minimum of 4 frames.
		In Phase 3, it's a constant 16 frames instead.</li>
		<li>All Phase 2 patterns are fired for 28 frames, after a 16-frame
		gather animation. The Phase 3 pattern time starts at 80 frames and
		increases by 24 frames for the first 6 patterns, ending at 200 frames
		for all later ones.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Phase 4 consists of the single laser corridor pattern with additional
	random bullets every 16 frames.</li>
</ul><p>
	And that's all the {{HTML_TagInline "gameplay"}}-relevant detail that ZUN put into Sara's code. It doesn't even make sense to describe the remaining
	patterns in depth, as their groups can significantly change between
	difficulties and rank values. The
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-04-30" "general code structure of TH05 bosses"}}
	won't ever make for {{HTML_TagInline "good-code"}}, but Sara's code is just a
	lesser example of what I already documented for Shinki.<br>
	So, no bugs, no unused content, only inconsequential bloat to be found here,
	and less than 1 push to get it done… That makes 9 PC-98 Touhou bosses
	decompiled, with 22 to go, and gets us over the sweet 50% overall
	finalization mark! 🎉 And sure, it might be possible to pass through the
	lasers in Sara's final pattern, but the boss script just controls the
	origin, angle, and activity of lasers, so any quirk there would be part of
	the laser code… wait, you can do <i>what</i>?!?
</p><hr><p>
	TH05 expands TH04's one-off code for Yuuka's Master and Double Sparks into a
	more featureful laser system, and Sara is the first boss to show it off.
	Thus, it made sense to look at it again in more detail and finalize the code
	I had purportedly
	{{Blog_PostLink "2018-12-16" "reverse-engineered over 4 years ago"}}.
	That very short delivery notice already hinted at a very time-consuming
	future finalization of this code, and that prediction certainly came true.
	On the surface, <i>all</i> of the low-level laser ray rendering and
	collision detection code is undecompilable: It uses the <code>SI</code> and
	<code>DI</code> registers without Turbo C++'s safety backups on the stack,
	and its helper functions take their input and output parameters from
	convenient registers, completely ignoring common calling conventions. And
	just to raise the confusion even further, the code doesn't just <i>set</i>
	these registers for the helper function calls and then restores their
	original values, but <i>permanently shifts them via additions and
	subtractions</i>. Unfortunately, these convenient registers also include the
	<code>BP</code> base pointer to the stack frame of a function… and shifting
	that register throws any intuition behind accessed local variables right out
	of the window for a good part of the function, requiring a correctly shifted
	view of the stack frame just to make sense of it again.
	{{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} How could such code even have been written?! This
	goes well beyond the already wrong assumption that using more stack space is
	somehow bad, and straight into the territory of self-inflicted pain.
</p><p>
	So while it's not a lot of instructions, it's quite dense and really hard to
	follow. This code would <i>really</i> benefit from a decompilation that
	anchors all this madness as much as possible in existing C++ structures… so
	let's decompile it anyway? {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br>
	Doing so would involve emitting lots of raw machine code bytes to hide the
	<code>SI</code> and <code>DI</code> registers from the compiler, but I
	already had a certain
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-16" "batshit insane compiler bug workaround abstraction"}}
	lying around that could make such code more readable. Hilariously, it only
	took this one additional use case for that abstraction to reveal itself as
	premature and way too complicated. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Expanding
	the core idea into a full-on x86 instruction generator ended up simplifying
	the code structure a lot. All we really want there is a way to set all
	potential parameters to e.g. a specific form of the <code>MOV</code>
	instruction, which can all be expressed as the parameters to a force-inlined
	<code>__emit__()</code> function. Type safety <i>can</i> help by providing
	overloads for different operand widths here, but there really is no need for
	classes, templates, or explicit specialization of templates based <i>on</i>
	classes. We only need a couple of <code>enum</code>s with opcode, register,
	and prefix constants from the x86 reference documentation, and a set of
	associated macros that token-paste pseudoregisters onto the prefixes of
	these <code>enum</code> constants.<br>
	And that's how you get a custom compile-time assembler in a 1994 C++
	compiler and expand the limits of decompilability even further. What's even
	truly left now? Self-modifying code, layout tricks that can't be replicated
	with regularly structured control flow… and that's it. That leaves quite a
	few functions I previously considered undecompilable to be revisited once I
	get to work on making this game more portable.
</p><p>
	With that, we've turned the low-level laser code into the expected horrible
	monstrosity that exposes all the hidden complexity in those few ASM
	instructions. The high-level part should be no big deal now… except that
	we're immediately bombarded with <code>Fixup overflow</code> errors at link
	time? Oh well, time to finally learn the true way of fixing this highly
	annoying issue in a <i>second</i> new piece of decompilation tech – and one
	that might actually be useful for other x86 Real Mode retro developers at
	that.<br>
	Earlier in the RE history of TH04 and TH05, I often wrote about the need to
	split the two original code segments into multiple segments within two
	<i>groups</i>, which makes it possible to slot in code from different
	translation units at arbitrary places within the original segment. If we
	don't want to define a unique segment name for each of these slotted-in
	translation units, we need a way to set custom segment and group names in C
	land. Turbo C++ offers two <code>#pragma</code>s for that:
</p><ul>
	<li><code>#pragma option -zCsegment -zPgroup</code> – preferred in most
	cases as it's equivalent to setting the default segment and group via the
	command line, but can only be used at the beginning of a translation unit,
	before the first non-preprocessor and non-comment C language token</li>
	<li><code>#pragma codeseg segment &lt;group&gt;</code> – necessary if a
	translation unit needs to emit code into two or more segments</li>
</ul><p>
	For the most part, these <code>#pragma</code>s work well, but they seemed to
	not help much when it came to calling <code>near</code> functions declared
	in different segments within the same group. It took a bit of trial and
	error to figure out what was actually going on in that case, but there
	<i>is</i> a clear logic to it:
</p><ul>
	<li>Symbols are allocated to the segment and group that's active during
	their first appearance, no matter whether that appearance is a declaration
	or definition. Any later appearance of the function in a different segment
	is ignored.</li>
	<li>The linker calculates the 16-bit offsets of such references relative to
	the symbol's <i>declared</i> segment, not its actual one. Turbo C++ does
	<i>not</i> show an error or warning if the declared and actual segments are
	different, as referencing the same symbol from multiple segments is a valid
	use case. The linker merely throws the <code>Fixup overflow</code> error if
	the calculated distance exceeds 64 KiB and thus couldn't <i>possibly</i> fit
	within a <code>near</code> reference. With a wrong segment declaration
	though, your code can be incorrect long before a fixup hits that limit.</li>
</ul><p>
	Summarized in code:
</p><pre>#pragma option -zCfoo_TEXT -zPfoo

void bar(void);
void near qux(void); // defined somewhere else, maybe in a different segment

#pragma codeseg baz_TEXT baz

// Despite the segment change in the line above, this function will still be
// put into `foo_TEXT`, the active segment during the first appearance of the
// function name.
void bar(void) {
}

// This function hasn't been declared yet, so it will go into `baz_TEXT` as
// expected.
void baz(void) {
	// This `near` function pointer will be calculated by subtracting the
	// flat/linear address of qux() inside the binary from the base address
	// of qux()'s declared segment, i.e., `foo_TEXT`.
	void (near *ptr_to_qux)(void) = qux;
}</pre><p>
	So yeah, you might have to put <code>#pragma codeseg</code> into your
	<i>headers</i> to tell the linker about the correct segment of a
	<code>near</code> function in advance. 🤯 This is an important insight for
	everyone using this compiler, and I'm shocked that none of the Borland C++
	books documented the interaction of code segment definitions and
	<code>near</code> references at least at this level of clarity. The TASM
	manuals did have a few pages on the topic of groups, but that syntax
	obviously doesn't apply to a C compiler. Fixup overflows in particular are
	such a common error and really deserved better than the unhelpful <q>🤷</q>
	of an explanation that ended up in the <i>User's Guide</i>. Maybe this whole
	technique of custom code segment names was considered arcane even by 1993,
	judging from the mere three sentences that <code>#pragma codeseg</code> was
	documented with? Still, it must have been common knowledge among Amusement
	Makers, because they couldn't have built these exact binaries without
	knowing about these details. This is the true solution to
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-07-31" "any issues involving references to <code>near</code> functions"}},
	and I'm glad to see that ZUN did <i>not</i> in fact lie to the compiler. 👍
</p><hr><p>
	OK, but <i>now</i> the remaining laser code compiles, and we get to write
	C++ code to draw some hitboxes during the two collision-detected states of
	each laser. These confirm what the low-level code from earlier already
	uncovered: Collision detection against lasers is done by testing a
	12×12-pixel box at every 16 pixels along the length of a laser, which leaves
	obvious 4-pixel gaps at regular intervals that the player can just pass
	through. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} This adds
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "yet"}}
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-10" "another"}}
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-08" "quirk"}} to the growing list of quirks that
	were either intentional or must have been deliberately left in the game
	after their initial discovery. This is what constants were invented for, and
	there really is no excuse for not using them – <i>especially</i> during
	intoxicated coding, and/or if you don't have a compile-time abstraction for
	Q12.4 literals.
</p><figure {{$vid_gaps_0.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_gaps_0 $vid_gaps_1.FlipActive}}
	<figcaption>
		When detecting laser collisions, the game checks the player's single
		center coordinate against any of the aforementioned 12×12-pixel boxes.
		Therefore, it's correct to split these 12×12 pixels into two 6×6-pixel
		boxes and assign the other half to the player for a more natural
		visualization. Always remember that hitbox visualizations need to keep
		all colliding entities in mind –
		{{Blog_PostLink "2021-07-31" "assigning a constant-sized hitbox to \"the player\" and \"the bullets\" will be wrong in most other cases"}}.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Using subpixel coordinates in collision detection also introduces a slight
	inaccuracy into any hitbox visualization recorded in-engine on a 16-color
	PC-98. Since we have to render discrete pixels, we cannot exactly place a
	Q12.4 coordinate in the 93.75% of cases where the fractional part is
	non-zero. This is why pretty much every laser segment hitbox in the video
	above shows up as 7×7 rather than 6×6: The actual W×H area of each box is 13
	pixels smaller, but since the hitbox lies <i>between</i> these pixels, we
	cannot indicate <i>where</i> it lies <i>exactly</i>, and have to err on the
	side of caution. It's also why Reimu's box slightly changes size as she
	moves: Her non-diagonal movement speed is 3.5 pixels per frame, and the
	constant focused movement in the video above halves that to 1.75 pixels,
	making her end up on an exact pixel every 4 frames. Looking forward to the
	glorious future of displays that will allow us to scale up the playfield to
	16× its original pixel size, thus rendering the game at its exact internal
	resolution of 6144×5888 pixels. Such a port would definitely add a lot of
	value to the game…
</p><p>
	The remaining high-level laser code is rather unremarkable for the most
	part, but raises one final interesting question: With no explicitly defined
	limit, how wide can a laser be? Looking at the laser structure's 1-byte
	width field and the unsigned comparisons all throughout the update and
	rendering code, the answer seems to be an obvious 255 pixels. However, the
	laser system also contains an automated shrinking state, which can be most
	notably seen in Mai's wheel pattern. This state shrinks a laser by 2 pixels
	every 2 frames until it reached a width of 0. This presents a problem with
	odd widths, which would fall below 0 and overflow back to 255 due to the
	unsigned nature of this variable. So rather than, I don't know, treating
	width values of 0 as invalid and stopping at a width of 1, or even adding a
	condition for that specific case, the code <i>just performs a signed
	comparison</i>, effectively limiting the width of a shrinkable laser to a
	maximum of 127 pixels. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} This small signedness
	inconsistency now forces the distinction between shrinkable and
	non-shrinkable lasers onto every single piece of code that uses lasers. Yet
	another instance where
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-11" "aiming for a cinematic 30 FPS look"}}
	made the resulting code much more complicated than if ZUN had just evenly
	spread out the subtraction across 2 frames. 🤷<br>
	Oh well, it's not as if any of the fixed lasers in the original scripts came
	close to any of these limits. Moving lasers are much more streamlined and
	limited to begin with: Since they're hardcoded to 6 pixels, the game can
	safely assume that they're always thinner than the 28 pixels they get
	gradually widened to during their decay animation.
</p><p>
	Finally, in case you were missing a mention of hitboxes in the previous
	paragraph: Yes, the game always uses the aforementioned 12×12 boxes,
	regardless of a laser's width.
</p><figure {{$vid_giant.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_giant}}
	<figcaption>This video also showcases the 127-pixel limit because I wanted
	to include the shrink animation for a seamless loop.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	That was what, 50% of this blog post just being about complications that
	made laser difficult for no reason? Next up: The first TH01 Anniversary
	Edition build, where I finally get to reap the rewards of having a 100%
	decompiled game and write some <i>good</i> code for once.
