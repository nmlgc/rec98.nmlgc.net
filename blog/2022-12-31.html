&gt; Blocked by <a href="https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/Translate/+/871904">one final critical bug that really should be fixed upstream</a>
&gt; Code reviewers are probably on vacation</blockquote><p>
	And so, the year unfortunately ended with yet another slow month. During the
	MediaWiki upgrade, I was slowly decompiling the TH05 Sara fight on the side,
	but stumbled over one interesting but high-maintenance detail there that
	would really enhance her blog post. TH02 would need a lot of attention for
	the basic rendering calls as well…
</p><p>
	…so let's end the year with Shuusou Gyoku instead, looking at its most
	critical issue in particular. As if that were the easy option here…
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p>{{call .TOC}}<hr><p id="32bit-{{.Date}}">
	The game does not run properly on modern Windows systems due to its usage of
	the ancient DirectDraw APIs, with issues ranging from unbearable slowdown to
	glitched colors to the game not even starting at all. Thankfully, Shuusou
	Gyoku is not the only ancient Windows game affected by these issues, and
	people have developed a variety of generic DirectDraw wrappers and patches
	for playing such games on modern systems. Out of all these, <a
	href="https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat">DDrawCompat</a> is one of the
	simpler solutions for Shuusou Gyoku in particular: Just drop its
	<code>ddraw</code> proxy DLL into the game directory, and the game will run
	as it's supposed to.<br />
	So let's just bundle that DLL with all my future Shuusou Gyoku releases
	then? That <i>would</i> have been the quick and dirty option, coming with
	several drawbacks:
</p><ul>
	<li>Linux users might be annoyed by the potential need to configure a native
	DLL override for <code>ddraw.dll</code>. It's not too much of an issue as we
	could simply rename the DLL and replace the import with the new name.
	However, doing that reproducibly would already involve changes to either the
	DDrawCompat or Shuusou Gyoku build process.</li>
	<li>Win32 API hooking is another potential point of failure in general,
	requiring continual maintenance for new Windows versions. This is not even a
	hypothetical concern: DDrawCompat does rely on particularly volatile Win32
	API details, to the point that the recent Windows 11 22H2 update <a
	href="https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/commit/f1d8dbd1cb96fb641c31d55c9cf576406a5c2d01">completely
	broke it, causing a hang at startup that required a workaround</a>.<br />
	But sure, it's still just a single third-party component. Keeping it up to
	date doesn't sound too bad by itself…</li>
	<li>…if DDrawCompat weren't evolving way beyond what we need to keep Shuusou
	Gyoku running. Being a typical DirectDraw wrapper, it has always aimed to
	solve all sorts of issues in old DirectDraw games. However, the latest
	version, 0.4.0, has gone above and beyond in this regard, adding <a
	href="https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/wiki/Configuration">lots of
	configuration options</a> with default settings that <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/3#issuecomment-1264267695">actually
	break Shuusou Gyoku</a>.<br />
	To get a glimpse of how this is likely to play out, we only have to look at
	the more mature <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/">DxWnd</a>
	project. In its expert mode, DxWnd features three rows of tabs, each packed
	with checkboxes that toggle individual hacks, and <i>most</i> of these are
	related to <i>something</i> that Shuusou Gyoku could be affected by. Imagine
	checking a precise permutation of a three-digit number of checkboxes just to
	keep an old game running at full speed on modern systems…</li>
	<li>Finally, aesthetic and bloat considerations. If
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-09-04" "C++ fstreams"}} were already too embarrassing
	with the ~100&nbsp;KB of bloat they add to the binary, a 565&nbsp;KiB DLL is
	even worse. And that's the <i>old</i> version 0.3.2 – version 0.4.0 comes in
	at 2.43&nbsp;<i>MiB</i>.</li>
</ul><p>
	Fortunately, I had the budget to dig a bit deeper and figure out what
	<i>exactly</i> DDrawCompat does to make Shuusou Gyoku work properly. Turns
	out that among all the hooks and patches, the game only needs the most
	central one: Enforcing a 32-bit display mode regardless of whatever lower
	bit depth the game requests natively, combined with converting the game's
	pixel buffer to 32-bit on the fly.<br />
	So does this mean that adding 32-bit to the game's list of supported bit
	depths is everything we have to do?
</p><figure class="fullres pixelated"><img
	src="{{$32bit}}"
	alt="The new 32-bit rendering option in the Shuusou Gyoku P0226 build."
/><figcaption>
	Interestingly, Shuusou Gyoku already saved the DirectDraw enumeration flag
	that indicates support for 32-bit display modes. The official version just
	did nothing with it.
</figcaption></figure><p>
	Well, <i>almost</i> everything. Initially, this surprised me as well: With
	all the <code>if</code> statements checking for precise bit depths, you
	would think that supporting one more bit depth would be way harder in this
	code base. As it turned out though, these conditional branches are not
	<i>really</i> about 8-bit or 16-bit color for the most part, but instead
	differentiate between two very distinct rendering approaches:
</p><ul>
	<li>"8-bit" is a pure 2D mode with palettized colors,</li>
	<li>while "16-bit" is a hybrid 2D/3D mode that uses Direct3D <span
	class="hovertext" title="(sic)">2</span> on top of DirectDraw, with
	3-channel RGB colors.</li>
</ul></p><p>
	Consequently, most of these branches deal with differences between these two
	approaches that couldn't be nicely abstracted away in pbg's renderer
	interface: Specific palette changes that are exclusive to "8-bit" mode, or
	certain entities and effects whose Direct3D draw calls in "16-bit" mode
	require tailor-made approximations for the "8-bit" mode. Since our new
	32-bit mode is equivalent to the 16-bit mode in all of these branches, I
	only needed to replace the raw number comparisons with more meaningful
	method calls.
</p><p>
	That only left a very small number of 2D raster effects that directly write
	to or read from DirectDraw surface memory, and therefore do need to know the
	bit size of each pixel. Thanks to <code>std::variant</code> and
	<code>std::visit()</code>, adding 32-bit support becomes trivial here: By
	rewriting the code in a generic manner that derives all offsets from the
	template type, you only have to say <q><a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/commit/20e4544efcdcd01fd70c74fd312c2bc86821ee2f">hey,
	I'd like to have 32-bit as well</a></q>, and C++ will automatically
	instantiate correct 32-bit variants of all bit depth-dependent code
	snippets.<br />
	There are only three features in the entire game that access pixel buffers
	this way: a color key retrieval function, the lens ball animation on the
	logo screen, and… the ending staff roll? Sure, the text sprites fade in and
	out, but so does the picture next to it, using Direct3D alpha blending or
	palette color ramping depending on the current rendering mode. Instead, the
	only reason why these sprites directly access their pixel buffer is… an
	unused and pretty wild spiral effect. 😮 It's still part of the code, and
	only doesn't show up because <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/blob/a7d4ccd2e2c4f38db68804f010ac4d6b930d51a7/GIAN07/ENDING.CPP#L314-L319">the
	parameters that control its timing were commented out before release</a>:
</p><figure {{$spiral.FigureAttrs}}>{{call .VideoPlayer $spiral}}<figcaption>
	They probably considered it <i>too </i> wild for the <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRbwQahZBsE">mood</a> of this
	ending.<br />
	The main ending text was the only remaining issue of mojibake present in my
	previous Shuusou Gyoku builds, and is now fixed as well. Windows <i>can</i>
	render Shift-JIS text via GDI even outside Japanese locale, but only when
	explicitly selecting a font that supports the <code>SHIFTJIS_CHARSET</code>,
	and the game simply didn't select <i>any</i> font for rendering this text.
	Thus, GDI fell back onto its default font, which obviously is only
	guaranteed to support the <code>SHIFTJIS_CHARSET</code> if your system
	locale is set to Japanese. This is why the font in the original game might
	<a href="https://youtu.be/IWOhouJ7c04?t=1241">look</a> <a
	href="https://youtu.be/lRH-fhSaDSE?t=361s">different</a> between systems.
	For my build, I chose the font that would appear on a clean Windows
	installation – a basic 400-weighted MS Gothic at font size 16, which is
	already used all throughout the game.
</figcaption></figure><p>
	Alright, 32-bit mode complete, let's set it as the default if possible… and
	break compatibility to the original <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code> format in the
	process? When validating this file, the original game only allows the
	originally supported 8-bit or 16-bit modes. Setting the
	<code>BitDepth</code> field to any other value causes the <i>entire</i> file
	to be reset to its defaults, re-locking the Extra Stage in the process.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}<br />
	Introducing a <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/34">backward-compatible version
	system for <code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code></a> was beyond the scope of this push.
	Changing the validation to a per-field approach was a good small first step
	to take though. The new build no longer validates the <code>BitDepth</code>
	field against a fixed list, but against the actually supported bit depths on
	your system, picking a different supported one if necessary. With the
	original approach, this would have caused your entire configuration to fail
	the validation check. Instead, you can now safely update to the new build
	without losing your option settings, or your previously unlocked access to
	the Extra Stage.<br />
	Side note: The validation limit for starting bombs is off by one, and the
	one for starting lives check is off by two. By modifying
	<code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>, you could theoretically get new games to start with
	7 lives and 3 bombs… if you then calculate a correct checksum for your
	hacked config file, that is. 🧑‍💻
</p><p>
	Interestingly, DirectDraw doesn't even indicate support for 8-bit or 16-bit
	color on systems that are affected by the initially mentioned issues.
	Therefore, these issues are <i>not</i> the fault of DirectDraw, but of
	Shuusou Gyoku, as the original release requested a bit depth <i>that it has
	even verified to be unsupported</i>. Unfortunately, Windows sides with
	<s>Sim City</s> Shuusou Gyoku here: If you previously experimented with the
	Windows app compatibility settings, you might have ended up with the
	<code>DWM8And16BitMitigation</code> flag assigned to the full file path of
	your Shuusou Gyoku executable in either
</p><ul>
	<li><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers</code>, or</li>
	<li><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers</code></li>
</ul><p>
	As the term <i>mitigation</i> suggests, these modes are (poorly) emulated,
	which is exactly what causes the issues with this game in the first place.
	Sure, this might be the lesser evil from the point of view of an operating
	system: If you don't have the budget for a full-blown DDrawCompat-style
	DirectDraw wrapper, you might consider it better for users to have the game
	run poorly than have it fail at startup due to incorrect API usage.
	Controlling this with a flag that sticks around for future runs of a binary
	is definitely suboptimal though, <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/33">especially given how hard it
	is to programmatically remove this flag within the binary itself</a>. It
	only adds additional complexity to the ideal clean upgrade path.<br />
	So, make sure to check your registry and manually remove these flags for the
	time being. Without them, the new <i>Config → Graphic</i> menu will
	correctly prevent you from selecting anything else but 32-bit on modern
	Windows.
</p><hr /><p id="unicode-{{.Date}}">
	After all that, there was just enough time left in this push to implement
	basic locale independence, as requested by the <i>Seihou development</i>
	Discord group, without looking into automatic fixes for previous mojibake
	filenames yet. Combining <code>std::filesystem::path</code> with the native
	Win32 API should be straightforward and bloat-free, especially with all the
	abstractions I've been building, right?<br />
	Well, turns out that <code>std::filesystem::path</code> does not
	<i>actually</i> meet my expectations. At least as long as it's not
	<code>constexpr</code>-enabled, because you <i>still</i> get the unfortunate
	conversion from narrow to wide encoding at runtime, even for globals with
	static storage duration. That brings us back to writing our path abstraction
	in terms of the regular <code>std::string</code> and
	<code>std::wstring</code> containers, which at least allow us to enforce the
	respective encoding at compile time. Even <code>std::string_view</code> only
	adds to the complexity here, as its strings are never inherently
	null-terminated, which is required by both the POSIX and Win32 APIs. Not to
	mention dynamic filenames: C++20's <code>std::format()</code> would be the
	obvious idiomatic choice here, but using it almost <i>doubles</i> the size
	of the compiled binary… 🤮<br />
	In the end, the most bloat-free way of implementing C++ file I/O in 2023 is
	still the same as it was 30 years ago: Call system APIs, roll a custom
	abstraction that conditionally uses the <code>L</code> prefix, and pass
	around raw pointers. And if you need a dynamic filename, just write the
	dynamic characters into arrays at fixed positions. Just as PC-98 Touhou used
	to do… {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	Oh, and the game's window also uses a Unicode title bar now.
</ul><p>
	And that's it for this push! Make sure to rename your configuration
	(<code>秋霜CFG.DAT</code>), score (<code>秋霜SC.DAT</code>), and replay
	(<code>秋霜りぷ*.DAT</code>) filenames if you were previously running the
	game on a non-Japanese locale, and then grab the new build:

	With that, we've got the most critical bugs out of the way, but the <a

	potential fixes and features in Shuusou Gyoku</a> has only increased.

	Next up: Starting the new year with all my plans hopefully working out for
