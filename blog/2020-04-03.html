	Wait, PI for <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> is mainly blocked by the high score
	menu? That one should <i>really</i> be properly decompiled in a separate
	RE push, since it's also present in largely identical form in
	<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>… but I currently lack the explicit funding to do
	that.
</p><p>
	And as it turns out, I shouldn't really capture any of the existing generic
	RE contributions for it either. Back in 2018 when I ran the crowdfunding
	on the {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} Discord server, I said that generic RE
	contributions would never go towards TH01. No one was interested in that
	game back then, and as it's significantly different from all the other
	games, it made sense to only cover it if explicitly requested.<br>
	As {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} still remains one of the biggest supporters and
	advertisers for ReC98, someone recently believed that this rule was still
	in effect, despite not being mentioned anywhere on this website.
</p><p>
	Fast forward to today, and TH01 has become the single most supported game
	lately, with plenty of incomplete pushes still open to be completed.
	Reverse-engineering it has proven to be quite efficient, yielding lots of
	completion percentage points per push. This, I suppose, is exactly what
	backers that don't give any specific priorities are mainly interested in.
	Therefore, <i>I <strong>will</strong> allocate future partial
	contributions to TH01, whenever it makes sense</i>.
</p><p>
	So, instead of rushing TH01 PI, let's wait for {{DB_CustomerByID 13}}'s
	April subscription, and get the 25% total RE milestone with some TH05 PI
	progress instead. This one primarily focused on the gather circles
	(spirals…?), the third-last missing entity type in TH05. These are
	rendered using the same 8×8 pellet sprite introduced in TH02… except that
	the <i>actual</i> pellets received a darkened bottom part in TH04
	<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAgAAAAIAgMAAAC5YVYYAAAAGXRFWHRDb21tZW50AENyZWF0ZWQgd2l0aCBHSU1QV4EOFwAAAAlQTFRFAAAAqqr/////38h8nAAAAAF0Uk5TAEDm2GYAAAAeSURBVAjXY+BawKC1gmHVKoZVK0EoaymDaAgDawAAXhcHRDMdG+8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=">.
	Which, in turn, is actually rendered quite efficiently – the games first
	render the top white part of all pellets, followed by the bottom gray part
	of all pellets. The PC-98 GRCG is used throughout the process, doing its
	typical job of accelerating monochrome blitting, and by arranging the
	rendering like this, only two GRCG color changes are required to draw any
	number of pellets. I <i>guess</i> that makes it quite a worthwhile
	optimization? Don't ask me for specific performance numbers or even saved
	cycles, though {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	Next up, one more TH05 PI push!
