	Secured a 30-hour RL workweek to leave plenty of time for this project,
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}}'s commissioned MediaWiki update work is also nearing
	completion, time to reopen the store! Since it's been a long time, here's
	an overview of where we currently are in each game and binary, and what
	the next logical step would be:
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>TH01:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> Main menu and game initialization.</li>
		<li><code>REIIDEN.EXE:</code> In order: Elis, Kikuri, SinGyoku, remaining code for missile bullets, cards and obstacles, Mima, YuugenMagan, the end-of-stage and TOTLE tallys, the bomb animation, the debug menu, <code>main()</code>, and we're done!</li>
		<li><code>FUUIN.EXE:</code> The verdict screen, followed by the boss slideshow.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH02:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> Got a few variables and functions here and there, but not a single gameplay-related structure yet. The game seems to have a weird sprite system; looks like that'll be first.</li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> The ending sequences.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH03:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> Story Mode initialization, or the title screen.</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> The enemy structure? Or the bullet structure, maybe? Either way, we're still missing a lot of essential gameplay structures. At least we did make {{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-20" "first"}} {{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-29" "steps"}} in this game, in contrast to TH02.</li>
		<li><code>MAINL.EXE:</code> The stage end / VS dialogue followed by the stage start screen.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH04:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> The game title slide-in animation, followed by the High Score menu and the Music Room. The latter will be done in parallel with the TH05 version.</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code><ul>
			<li>Turns out that this game has a {{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-29" "shared structure for custom entity types"}} after all. Looking at that one would also get us pretty close to 100% PI.</li>
			<li>Otherwise, we could decompile the last missing piece of bullet update code, in parallel with TH05</li>
			<li>… or the big "Master Spark" laser, with Gengetsu's boss script afterward, …</li>
			<li>… or HUD rendering (in parallel with TH05).</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> High score name entry, or ending script parsing in parallel with TH05.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>TH05:</strong><ul>
		<li><code>OP.EXE:</code> High Score menu, followed by the Music Room. Will be done in parallel with TH04's version.</li>
		<li><code>MAIN.EXE:</code> Finishing PI created quite a lot of segment splits where we could immediately continue: <ul>
			<li>the last missing piece of bullet update code, in parallel with TH04</li>
			<li>items and extends</li>
			<li>the Mai & Yuki fight script</li>
			<li>the EX-Alice fight script</li>
			<li>bomb rendering</li>
			<li>The boss background animations of Stage ≤5</li>
			<li>HUD rendering (in parallel with TH04, and getting us right in front of some boss sprite animations)</li>
			<li>player shot collision detection and rendering</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><code>MAINE.EXE:</code> The staff roll animation, or ending script parsing in parallel with TH04.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>
	But as always, you can request pretty much any other part of any game.
	We're now at a pretty good place as far as arbitrary requests are
	concerned, as I simply can't decide myself where to put all the current
	pending contributions in the <a href="/fundlog">funding backlog</a>. 😅 By
	spending only the missing amount of muny to complete any of those, you can
	capture any of those "fractional" contributions towards a specific goal.
</p><p>
	The next specific requests are going to set the priorities of this project
	for quite some time! The best strategy: Spend a low amount of money on
	something very specific, and watch as existing generic contributions will
	necessarily have to be put towards making that specific goal happen 😛
