	Yes, I'm still alive. This delivery was just plagued by all of the worst
	luck: Data loss, physical hard drive failure, exploding phone batteries,
	minor illness… and after taking 4 weeks to recover from all of that, I had
	to face <i>this</i> beast of a task. 😵
</p><p>
	Turns out that neither part of improving video performance and usability on
	this blog was particularly easy. Decently encoding the videos into all
	web-supported formats required unexpected trade-offs even for the low-res,
	low-color material we are working with, and writing custom video player
	controls added the timing precision resistance of HTML
	<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> on top of the inherent complexity of frontend web
	development. Why did this need to be 800 lines of commented JavaScript and
	200 lines of commented CSS, and consume almost more than 5 pushes?!
	Apparently, the latest price increase also seemed to have raised the minimum
	level of acceptable polish in my work, since that's more than the maximum of
	3.67 pushes it should have taken. To fund the rest, I stole some of the
	reserved JIS trail word rendering research pushes, which means that the next
	{{HTML_Currency 10000}} towards anything will go back towards that goal.
</p><hr><p>
	The codec situation is especially sad because it seems like so much of a
	solved problem. ZMBV, the lossless capture codec introduced by DOSBox, is
	both very well suited for retro game footage and remarkably simple too:
	DOSBox-X's implementation of both an encoder and decoder comes in at under
	650 lines of C++, excluding the Deflate implementation. Heck, the AVI
	container <i>around</i> the codec is more complicated to write than the
	compressed video data itself, and AVI is already the easiest choice you have
	for a widely supported video container format.<br>
	Currently, this blog contains 9:02 minutes of video across 86 files, with a
	total frame count of 24,515. In case this post attracts a general video
	encoding audience that isn't familiar with what I'm encoding here: The
	maximum resolution is 640×400, and most of the video uses 16 colors, with
	some parts occasionally using more. With ZMBV, the lossless source files
	take up 43.8&nbsp;MiB, and that's even <i>with</i> AVI's infamously bad
	overhead. While you can always spend more time on any compression task and
	precisely tune your algorithm to match your source data even better,
	43.8&nbsp;MiB looks like a more than reasonable amount for this type of
	content.
</p><p>
	Especially compared with what I actually have to ship here, because sadly,
	ZMBV is not supported by browsers. 😔 Writing a WebAssembly player for ZMBV
	would have certainly been interesting, but it already took 5 pushes to get
	to what we have now. So, let's instead shell out to ffmpeg and build a
	pipeline to convert ZMBV to the ill-suited codecs supported by web browsers,
	replacing the previously committed VP9 and VP8 files. From that point, we
	can then look into AV1, the latest and greatest web-supported video codec,
	to save some additional bandwidth.
</p><p>
	But first, we've got to gather all the ZMBV source files. While I was
	working on the {{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-10" "2022-07-10 blog post"}}, I
	noticed some weirdly washed-out colors in the converted videos, leading to
	the shocking realization that my previous, historically grown conversion
	script didn't <i>actually</i> encode in a lossless way. 😢 By extension,
	this meant that every video before that post could have had minor
	discolorations as well.<br>
	For the majority of videos, I still had the original ZMBV capture files
	straight out of DOSBox-X, and reproducing the final videos wasn't too big of
	a deal. For the few cases where I didn't, I went the extra mile, took the
	VP9 files, and manually fixed up all the minor color errors based on
	reference videos from the same gameplay stage. There might be a huge ffmpeg
	command line with a complicated filter graph to do the job, but for such a
	small 4-digit number of frames, it is much more straightforward to just dump
	each frame as an image and perform the color replacement with ImageMagick's
	<code>-opaque</code> and <code>-fill</code> options.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><hr><p>
	So, time to encode our new definite collection of source files into AV1, and
	<i>what the hell</i>, how slow <i>is</i> this codec? With ffmpeg's
	<code>libaom-av1</code>, fully encoding all 86 videos takes <i>almost 9
	hours</i> on my <a
	href="https://twitter.com/lunasorcery/status/1578483707979014144">mid-range
	development system</a>, regardless of the quality selected.<br>
	But sure, the encoded videos are managed by a cache, and this obviously only
	needs to be done once. If the results are amazing, they might even justify
	these glacial encoding speeds. Unfortunately, they don't: In its lossless
	<code>-crf 0</code> mode, AV1 performs even <i>worse</i> than VP9, taking up
	222&nbsp;MiB rather than 182&nbsp;MiB. It might not <i>sound</i> bad now,
	but as we're later going to find out, we want to have a <i>lot</i> of
	keyframes in these videos, which will blow up video sizes even further.
</p><p>
	So, time to go lossy and maybe take a deep dive into AV1 tuning? Turns out
	that it only gets worse from there:
</p><ul>
	<li>The alternative <code>libsvtav1</code> encoder is fast and creates small
	files… but even on the highest-quality settings, <code>-crf 0</code> and
	<code>-qp 0</code>, the video quality resembled the terrible x264 YUV420P
	format that Twitter enforces on uploaded videos.</li>
	<li>I don't remember the <code>librav1e</code> results, but they sure
	weren't convincing either.</li>
	<li><code>libaom-av1</code>'s <code>-usage realtime</code> option is a
	complete joke. 771&nbsp;MiB for all videos, and it doesn't even compress
	<i>in</i> real time on my system, more like 2.5× real-time. For comparison,
	a certain stone-age technology by the name of "animated GIF" would take
	54.3&nbsp;MiB, encode in sub-realtime (0.47×), and the only necessary tuning
	you need is an <a
	href="https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/">easily
	googled palette generation and usage filter</a>. Why can't I just use
	<i>those</i> in a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag?! These results have
	clearly proven the top-voted <q>just use modern video codecs</q> Stack
	Overflow answers wrong.</li>
	<li>What you're actually supposed to do is to drop <code>-cpu-used</code> to
	maybe 2 or 3, and then selectively add back prediction filters that suit
	your type of content. In our case, these are<ul>
		<li><code>-enable-palette</code></li>
		<li><code>-enable-rect-partitions</code> and friends</li>
		<li><code>-enable-intrabc</code> (<a
		href="https://thebroadcastknowledge.com/2020/11/05/video-av1-real-time-screen-content-coding/#video">source</a>)</li>
	</ul> and maybe others, depending on much time you want to waste.</li>
</ul><p>
	Because that's what all this tuning ended up being: a complete waste of
	time. No matter which tuning options I tried, all they did was cut down
	encoding time in exchange for slightly larger files on average. If there is
	a magic tuning option that would suddenly cause AV1 to maybe even beat ZMBV,
	I haven't found it. Heck, at particularly low settings,
	<code>-enable-intrabc</code> even caused blocky glitches with certain pellet
	patterns that looked like the internal frame block hashes were colliding all
	over the place. Unfortunately, I didn't save the video where it happened.
</p><p>
	So yeah, if you've already invested the computation time and encoded your
	content by just specifying a <code>-crf</code> value and keeping the
	remaining settings at their time-consuming defaults, any further tuning will
	make no difference. Which is… an interesting choice from a usability
	perspective. {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} I would have expected the exact
	opposite: default to a reasonably fast and efficient profile, and leave the
	vast selection of tuning options for those people to explore who <i>do</i>
	want to wait 5× as long for their encoder for that additional 5% of
	compression efficiency. On the other hand, that surely is one way to get
	people to extensively study your glorious engineering efforts, I guess? You
	know what would maybe even <i>motivate</i> people to intrinsically do that?
	Good documentation, with examples of the intent behind every option and its
	optimal use case. Nobody needs long help strings that just spell out all of
	the abbreviations that occur in the name of the option…<br>
	But hey, that at least means there's no reason to not use anything but ZMBV
	for storing and archiving the lossless source files. Best compression
	efficiency, encodes in real-time, and the files are much easier to edit.
</p><p>
	OK, end of rant. To understand why <a
	href="https://reddit.com/r/AV1">anyone</a> could be hyped about AV1 to begin
	with, we just have to compare it to VP9, not to ZMBV. In that light, AV1
	<i>is</i> pretty impressive even at <code>-crf 1</code>, compressing all 86
	videos to 68.9&nbsp;MiB, and even preserving 22.3% of frames completely
	losslessly. The remaining frames exhibit the exact kind of quality loss
	you'd want for retro game footage: Minor discoloration in individual pixels,
	so minuscule that subtracting the encoded image from the source yields an
	almost completely black image. Even after highlighting the errors by
	normalizing such a difference image, they are barely visible even if you
	know where to look. If "compressed PNG size of the normalized difference
	between ZMBV and AV1 <code>-crf 1</code>" is a useful metric, this would be
	its median frame among the 77.7% of non-lossless frames:

</figure><p>
	For comparison, here's the 13th worst one. The codec only resorts to color
	bleeding with particularly heavy effects, exactly where it doesn't matter:

</figure><p>
	Whether you can actually spot the difference is pretty much down to the
	glass between the physical pixels and your eyes. In any case, it's very
	hard, even if you know where to look. As far as I'm concerned, I can
	confidently call this "visually lossless", and it's definitely good enough
	for regular watching and even single-frame stepping on this blog.<br>
	Since the appeal of the original lossless files is undeniable though, I also
	made those more easily available. You can directly download the one for the
	currently active video with the <span style="font-family:
	ReC98 video player symbols;">⍗</span> button in the new video player – or <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/tree/master/blog/video/zmbv">directly
	get all of them from the Git repository</a> if you don't like clicking.
</p><hr><p>
	Unfortunately, even that only made up for half of the complexity in this
	pipeline. As impressive as the AV1 <code>-crf 1</code> result may be, it
	does in fact come with the drawback of also being impressively heavy to
	decode within today's browsers. Seeking is dog slow, with even the latencies
	for <i>single-frame stepping</i> being way beyond what I'd consider
	tolerable. To compensate, we have to invest another 78&nbsp;MiB into turning
	every 10<sup>th</sup> frame into a keyframe until single-stepping through an
	entire video becomes as fast as it could be on my system.<br>
	But fine, 146&nbsp;MiB, that's still less than the 178&nbsp;MiB that the old
	committed VP9 files used to take up. However, we still want to support VP9
	for <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=av1">older browsers, older
	hardware, and people who use Safari</a>. And it's this codec where keyframes
	are so bad that there is no clear best solution, only compromises. The main
	issue: The lower you turn VP9's <code>-crf</code> value, the slower the
	seeking performance <i>with the same number of keyframes</i>. Conversely,
	this means that raising quality also requires more keyframes for the same
	seeking performance – and at these file sizes, you really don't want to
	raise either. We're talking 1.2&nbsp;<i>GiB</i> for all 86 videos at
	<code>-crf 10</code> and <code>-g 5</code>, and even on that configuration,
	seeking takes 1.3× as long as it would in the optimal case.
</p><p>
	Thankfully, a full VP9 encode of all 86 videos only takes some 30 minutes as
	opposed to 9 hours. At that speed, it made sense to try a larger number of
	encoding settings during the ongoing development of the player. Here's a
	table with all the trials I've kept:

	But there simply was no satisfying solution around the ~200&nbsp;MiB mark
	with RGB colors, and even this compromise is still a disappointment in both
	size and seeking speed. Let's hope that <a
	href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia/kcmvideocodectype_av1/">Safari
	users do get AV1 support soon</a>… Heck, even VP8, with its exclusive
	support for YUV420P, performs much better here, with the impact of
	<code>-crf</code> on seeking speed being much less pronounced. Encoding VP8
	also just takes 3 minutes for all 86 videos, so I could have experimented
	much more. Too bad that it only matters for <i>really</i> ancient systems…
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}<br>
	Two final takeaways about VP9:
</p><ul>
	<li><code>-tune-content screen</code> and the tile options make no
	difference at all.</li>
	<li>All results used two-pass encoding. VP9 is the only codec where two
	passes made a noticeable difference, cutting down the final encoded size
	from 224&nbsp;MiB to 207&nbsp;MiB. For AV1, compression even seems to be
	slightly worse with two passes, yielding 154,201,892 bytes rather than the
	153,643,316 bytes we get with a single pass. But that's a difference of
	0.36%, and hardly significant.</li>
</ul><hr><p>
	Alright, <i>now</i> we're done with codecs and get to finish the work on the
	pipeline with perhaps its biggest advantage. With a ffmpeg conversion
	infrastructure in place, we can also easily output a video's first frame as
	a <i>poster</i> image to be passed into the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag.
	If this image is kept at the exact resolution of the video, the browser
	doesn't need to wait for an indeterminate amount of "video metadata" to be
	loaded, and can reserve the necessary space in the page layout much faster
	and without any of these dreaded loading spinners. For the big
	<code>/blog</code> page, this cuts down the minimum amount of required
	resources from 69.5 MB to 3.6 MB, finally making it usable again without
	waiting an eternity for the page to fully load. It's become pretty bad, so I
	really had to prioritize this task before adding any more blog posts on top.
</p><p>
	That leaves the player itself, which is basically a sum of lots of little
	implementation challenges. Single-frame stepping and seeking to discrete
	frames is the biggest one of them, as it's <a
	href="https://github.com/w3c/media-and-entertainment/issues/4"><i>technically</i>
	not possible within the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag</a>, which only
	returns the current time as a continuous value in seconds. It only <i>sort
	of</i> works for us because the backend can pass the necessary FPS and frame
	count values to the frontend. These allow us to place a discrete grid of
	frame "frets" at regular intervals, and thus establish a consistent mapping
	from frames to seconds and back. The only drawback here is a noticeably
	weird jump back by one frame when pausing a video within the second half of
	a frame, caused by snapping the continuous time in seconds back onto the
	frame grid in order to maintain a consistent frame counter. But the whole
	feature of frame-based seeking more than makes up for that.<br>
	The new scrubbable timeline might be even nicer to use with a mouse or a
	finger than just letting a video play regularly. With all the tuning work I
	put into keyframes, seeking is buttery smooth, and much better than the
	built-in <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> UI of either Chrome or Firefox.
	Unfortunately, it still costs a whole lot of CPU, but I'd say it's worth it.

	Finally, the new player also has a few features that might not be
	immediately obvious:
</p><ul>
	<li>Keybindings for almost everything you might want them for, indicated by
	hovering on top of each button. The tab switchers additionally support the
	↑&nbsp;Up and ↓&nbsp;Down keys to cycle through all tabs, or the number keys
	to jump to a specific tab. Couldn't find a way to indicate these mappings in
	the UI yet.</li>
	<li>Per-video captions now reserve the maximum height of any caption in the
	layout. This prevents layout reflows when switching through such videos,
	which previously caused quite annoying lag on the big <code>/blog</code>
	page.</li>
	<li>Useful fullscreen modes on both desktop and mobile, including all
	markers and the video caption. Firefox made this harder than it needed to
	be, and if it weren't for <code>display: contents</code>, the implementation
	would have been even worse. In the end though, we didn't even need any video
	pixel sizes from the backend – just as it should be…</li>
	<li>… and supporting Firefox was definitely worth it, as it's the only
	browser to support nearest-neighbor interpolation on videos.</li>
	<li>As some of the Unicode codepoints on the buttons aren't covered by the
	default fonts of some operating systems, I've taken them from the <a
	href="https://catrinity-font.de/">Catrinity font</a>, licensed under the SIL
	Open Font License. With <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/commit/3c2ffbf082149d7f86e0bc57a679e8547c04ff28">all
	the edits I did on this font</a>, that license definitely was necessary. I
	hope I applied it correctly though; it's not straightforward at all how to
	properly license a <q>Modified Version</q> of an original font with a
	<q>Reserved Font Name</q>.</li>
</ul><p>
	And with that, development hell is over, and I finally get to return to the
	core business! Just more than one month late. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
	Next up: Shipping the oldest still pending order, covering the TH04/TH05
	ending script format. Meanwhile, the Seihou community also wants to keep
	investing in Shuusou Gyoku, so we're also going to see more of that on the
	side.
