	So, here we have the first two pushes with an explicit focus on position
	independenceâ€¦ and they start out looking barely different from regular
	reverse-engineering? They even already deduplicate a bunch of item-related
	code, which was simple enough that it required little additional work?
	Because the actual work, once again, was in comparing uth05win's
	interpretations and naming choices with the original PC-98 code? So that
	we only ended up removing a handful of memory references there?
</p><p>
	(Oh well, you can mod item drops now!)
</p><p>
	So, continuing to interpret PI as a mere by-product of reverse-engineering
	might ultimately drive up the total PI cost quite a bit. But alright then,
	let's systematically clear out some false positives by looking at
	master.lib function calls insteadâ€¦ and suddenly we get the PI progress we
	were looking for, nicely spread out over all games since TH02. That kinda
	makes it sound like useless work, only done because it's dictated by some
	counting algorithm on a website. But decompilation will want to convert
	all of these values to decimal anyway. We're merely doing that right now,
	across all games.
</p><p>
	Then again, it doesn't <i>actually</i> make any game more
	position-independent, and only proves how position-independent it already
	was. So I'm <i>really</i> wondering right now whether I should just rush
	<i>actual</i> position independence by simply identifying structures and
	their sizes, and not bother with members or false positives until that's
	done. That would certainly get the job done for TH04 and TH05 in just a
	few more pushes, but then leave all the proving work (<i>and</i> the road
	to 100% PI on the front page) to reverse-engineering.
</p><p>
	I don't know. Would it be worth it to have a game that's "<i>maybe</i>
	fully position-independent", only for there to <i>maybe</i> be rare edge
	cases where it isn't?
</p><p>
	Or maybe, continuing to strike a balance between identifying false
	positives (fast) and reverse-engineering structures (slow) will continue
	to work out like it did now, and make us end up close to the current
	estimate, which was attractive enough to sell out the crowdfunding for the
	first timeâ€¦ ðŸ¤”
</p><p>
	Please give feedback! If possible, by Friday evening UTC+1, before I start
	working on the next PI push, this time with a focus on TH04.
