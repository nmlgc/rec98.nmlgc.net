	{{HTML_Emoji "stripe"}} <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> is now
	properly integrated into this website as an alternative to PayPal! Now, you
	can also financially support the project if PayPal doesn't work for you, or
	if you prefer <a
	href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview">using a
	provider out of Stripe's greater variety</a>. It's unfortunate that I had to
	ship this integration while the store is still sold out, but the Shuusou
	Gyoku OpenGL backend has turned out way too complicated to be finished next
	to these two pushes within a month. It will take quite a while until the
	store reopens and you all can start using Stripe, so I'll just link back to
	this blog post when it happens.
</p><p>
	Integrating Stripe wasn't the simplest task in the world either. At first,
	the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout">Checkout API</a>
	seems pretty friendly to developers: The entire payment flow is handled on
	the backend, in the server language of your choice, and requires no frontend
	JavaScript except for the UI feedback code you <i>choose</i> to write. Your
	backend API endpoint initiates the Stripe Checkout session, answers with a
	redirect to Stripe, and Stripe then sends a redirect back to your server if
	the customer completed the payment. Superficially, this server-based
	approach seems much more GDPR-friendly than PayPal, because there are no
	remote scripts to obtain consent for. In reality though, Stripe shares
	<i>much</i> more potential personal data about your credit card or bank
	account with a merchant, compared to PayPal's almost bare minimum of
	necessary data. {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}<br />
	It's also rather annoying how the backend has to persist the order form
	information throughout the entire Checkout session, because it would
	otherwise be lost if the server restarts while a customer is still busy
	entering data into Stripe's Checkout form. Compare that to the PayPal
	JavaScript SDK, which only <code>POST</code>s back to your server after the
	customer completed a payment. In Stripe's case, more JavaScript actually
	only makes the integration <i>harder</i>: If you trigger the initial payment
	HTTP request from JavaScript, you will <a
	href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/763#issuecomment-1430650132">have
	to improvise a bit to avoid the CORS error when redirecting away to a
	different domain</a>.
</p><p>
	But sure, it's all not too bad… for regular orders at least. With
	subscriptions, however, things get <i>much</i> worse. Unlike PayPal, Stripe
	kind of wants to stay out of the way of the payment process as much as
	possible, and just be a wrapper around its supported payment methods. So if
	customers aren't really meant to register with Stripe, how would they cancel
	their subscriptions? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}<br />
	Answer: <a
	href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/cancelling-a-subscription-made-through-stripe">Through
	the… merchant?</a> Which I quite dislike in principle, because why should
	you have to trust me to actually cancel your subscription after you
	requested it? It also means that I probably should add some sort of UI for
	self-canceling a Stripe subscription, ideally without adding full-blown user
	accounts. Not that this solves the underlying trust issue, but it's more
	convenient than contacting me via email or, worse, going through your bank
	somehow. Here is how my solution works:
</p><ul>
	<li>When setting up a Stripe subscription, the server will generate a random
	ID for authentication. This ID is then used as a <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">salt</a> for a hash
	of the Stripe subscription ID, linking the two without storing the latter on
	my server.</li>
	<li>The <q>thank you</q> page, which is parameterized with the Stripe
	<i>Checkout session</i> ID, will use that ID to retrieve the <i>subscription
	ID</i> via an API call to Stripe, and display it together with the above
	salt. This works indefinitely – contrary to what the expiry field in the
	<i>Checkout session</i> object suggests, Stripe sessions are indeed <a
	href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69600941/are-stripes-checkout-sessions-stored-forever">stored
	forever</a>. After all, Stripe also displays this session information in a
	merchant's transaction log with an excessive amount of detail. It might have
	been better to add my own expiration system to these pages, but this had
	been taking long enough already. For now, be aware that sharing the link to
	a Stripe <q>thank you</q> page is equivalent to sharing your subscription
	cancellation password.</li>
	<li>The salt is then used as the key for a subscription management page. To
	cancel, you visit this page and enter the Stripe subscription ID to confirm.
	The server then checks whether the salt and subscription ID pair belong to
	each other, and sends the actual <a
	href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/cancel">cancellation
	request</a> back to Stripe if they do.</li>
</ul><p>
	I might have gone a bit overboard with the crypto there, but I liked the
	idea of not storing any of the Stripe session IDs in the server database.
	It's not like that makes the system more complex anyway, and it's nice to
	have a separate confirmation step before canceling a subscription.
</p><p>
	But even <i>that</i> wasn't everything I had to keep in mind here. Once you
	switch from test to production mode for the final tests, you'll notice that
	certain <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area">SEPA</a>-based
	payment providers take their sweet time to process and activate new
	subscriptions. The Checkout session object even informs you about that, by
	including a <q>payment status</q> field. Which initially seems just like
	another field that could indicate hacking attempts, but treating it as such
	and rejecting any unpaid session can also reject perfectly valid
	subscriptions. I don't <i>want</i> all this control… 🥲<br />
	Instead, all I can do in this case is to tell you about it. In my test, the
	Stripe dashboard said that it might take days or even weeks for the initial
	subscription transaction to be confirmed. In such a case, the respective
	fraction of the cap will unfortunately need to remain <span
	class="incoming">red</span> for that entire time.
</p><p>
	And that was 1½ pushes just to replicate the basic functionality of a simple
	PayPal integration with the simplest type of Stripe integration. On the
	architectural site, all the necessary refactoring work made me finally
	upgrade my frontend code to TypeScript at least, using the amazing <a
	href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> to handle transpilation inside
	the server binary. Let's see how long it will now take for me to upgrade to
	SCSS…
</p><hr /><p>
	With the new payment options, it makes sense to go for another slight price
	increase, from {{HTML_Currency 7500}} up to {{HTML_Currency 8500}} per push.
	The amount of taxes I have to pay on this income is slowly becoming
	significant, and the store has been selling out almost immediately for the
	last few months anyway. If demand remains at the current level or even
	increases, I plan to gradually go up to {{HTML_Currency 12500}} by the end
	of the year. <br />
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-12-01" "As"}} {{Blog_PostLink "2022-08-15" "usual"}},
	I'm going to deliver existing orders in the backlog at the value they were
	originally purchased at. Due to the way the cap has to be calculated, these
	contributions now appear to have increased in value by a rather awkward
	13.33%.
</p><hr /><p>
	This left ½ of a push for some more work on the TH01 Anniversary Edition.
	Unfortunately, this was too little time for the grand issue of removing
	byte-aligned rendering of bigger sprites, which will need some additional
	blitting performance research. Instead, I went for a bunch of smaller
	bugfixes:
</p><ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<code>ANNIV.EXE</code> now launches <code>ZUNSOFT.COM</code> if
			MDRV98 wasn't resident before. In hindsight, it's completely obvious
			why this is the right thing to do: Either you start
			<code>ANNIV.EXE</code> directly, in which case there's no resident
			MDRV98 and you haven't seen the ZUN Soft logo, <i>or</i> you have
			made a single-line edit to <code>GAME.BAT</code> and replaced
			<code>op</code> with <code>anniv</code>, in which case MDRV98 is
			resident and you <i>have</i> seen the logo. These are the two
			reasonable cases to support out of the box. If you are doing
			anything else, it shouldn't be <i>that</i> hard to adjust though?
		</p><p>
			You might be wondering why I didn't just include all code of
			<code>ZUNSOFT.COM</code> inside <code>ANNIV.EXE</code> together with
			the rest of the game. The reason: <code>ZUNSOFT.COM</code> has
			almost nothing in common with regular TH01 code. While the rest of
			TH01 uses the custom image formats and bad rendering code I
			documented again and again during its RE process,
			<code>ZUNSOFT.COM</code> fully relies on master.lib for everything
			about the bouncing-ball logo animation. Its code is much closer to
			TH02 in that respect, which suggests that ZUN did in fact write this
			animation <i>for</i> TH02, and just included the binary in TH01 for
			consistency when he first sold both games together at Comiket 52.
			Unlike the {{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-05#single" "various bad reasons for splitting the PC-98 Touhou games into three main executables"}},
			it's still a good idea to split off animations that use a completely
			different set of rendering and file format functions. Combined with
			all the BFNT and shape rendering code, <code>ZUNSOFT.COM</code>
			actually contains even more unique code than <code>OP.EXE</code>,
			and only slightly less than <code>FUUIN.EXE</code>.
		</p></li>
	<li><p>
		The optional <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> is now correctly encoded in
		Shift-JIS instead of accidentally being UTF-8, fixing the previous
		mojibake in its final <code>ECHO</code> line.
	</p><li>
		<p>
			The command-line option that just adds a stage selection without
			other debug features (<code>anniv s</code>) now works reliably.
		</p><p>
			This one's quite interesting because it only ever worked
			<i>because</i> of a ZUN bug. From a superficial look at the code, it
			shouldn't: While the presence of an <code>'s'</code> branch proves
			that ZUN had such a mode during development, he nevertheless forgot
			to initialize the debug flag inside the resident structure within
			this branch. This mode only ever worked because master.lib's
			<code>resdata_create()</code> function doesn't clear the resident
			structure after allocation. If anything on the system previously
			happened to write something other than <code>0x00</code>,
			<code>0x01</code>, or <code>0x03</code> to the specific byte that
			then gets repurposed as the debug mode flag, this lack of
			initialization does in fact result in a distinct non-test and
			non-debug stage selection mode. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
			This is what happens on a certain widely circulated .HDI copy of
			TH01 that boots MS-DOS 3.30C. On this system, the memory that
			master.lib will allocate to the TH01 resident structure was
			previously used by DOS as stack for its kernel, which left the
			future resident debug flag byte at address <code>9FF6:0012</code> at
			a value of <code>0x12</code>. This might be the entire reason why
			<code>game s</code> is even widely documented to trigger a stage
			selection to begin with – on the widely circulated TH04 .HDI that
			boots MS-DOS 6.20, or on DOSBox-X, the <code>s</code> parameter
			doesn't work because both DOS systems leave the resident debug flag
			byte at <code>0x00</code>. And since <code>ANNIV.EXE</code> pushes
			MDRV98 into that area of conventional DOS RAM, <code>anniv s</code>
			previously didn't work even on MS-DOS 3.30C.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>
		Both bugs in the
		{{Blog_PostLink "2021-10-09" "1×1 particle system during the Mima fight"}}
		have been fixed. These include the off-by-one error that killed off the
		very first particle on the 80<sup>th</sup>
		frame and left it in VRAM, and, just like every other entity type, a
		replacement of ZUN's EGC unblitter with the new pixel-perfect and fast
		one. Until I've rearchitected unblitting as a whole, the particles will
		now merely rip barely visible 1×1 holes into the sprites they overlap.
	</p></li>
	<li><p>
		The {{Blog_PostLink "2021-09-28" "score popups for flipped cards"}} are now displayed without the two frames of flicker.
	</p></li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The <code>bomb</code> value shown in the lowest line of the in-game
			debug mode output is now right-aligned together with the rest of the
			values. This ensures that the game always writes a consistent number
			of characters to TRAM, regardless of the magnitude of the
			<code>bomb</code> value, preventing the seemingly wrong
			<code>timer</code> values that appeared in the original game
			whenever the value of the <code>bomb</code> variable changed to a
			lower number of digits:
		</p><figure>
			{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_debug_o.SetActive $vid_debug_a}}

	</li>
	<li><p>
		Finally, I've streamlined VRAM page access changes, which allowed me to
		consistently replace ZUN's expensive function call with the optimal two
		inlined x86 instructions. Interestingly, this change alone removed
		2&nbsp;KiB from the binary size, which is almost all of the difference
		between {{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-14" "the P0234-1 release"}} and this
		one. Let's see how much longer we can make each new release of
		<code>ANNIV.EXE</code> smaller than the previous one.
	</p></li>
</ul><p>
	The final point, however, raised the question of what we're now going to do
	about
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-17" "a certain issue in the <span lang='ja'>地﻿獄</span>/Jigoku Bad Ending"}}.
	ZUN's original expensive way of switching the accessed VRAM page was the
	main reason behind the lag frames on slower PC-98 systems, and
	search-replacing the respective function calls would immediately get us to
	the optimized version shown in that blog post. But is this something we
	actually want? If we wanted to retain the lag, we could surely preserve that
	function just for this one instance…<br /> The discovery of this issue
	predates the clear distinction between bloat, quirks, and bugs, so it makes
	sense to first classify what this issue even is. The distinction comes all
	down to <i>observability</i>, which I defined as changes to rendered frames
	between explicitly defined frame boundaries. That alone would be enough to
	categorize any cause behind lag frames as bloat, but it can't hurt to be
	more explicit here.
</p><p>
	Therefore, I now officially judge observability in terms of an infinitely
	fast PC-98 that can instantly render everything between two explicitly
	defined frames, and will never add additional lag frames. If we plan to port
	the games to faster architectures that aren't bottlenecked by disappointing
	blitter chips, this is the only reasonable assumption to make, in my
	opinion: The minimum system requirements in the games' README files are
	<i>minimums</i>, after all, not recommendations. Chasing the exact frame
	drop behavior that ZUN must have experienced during the time he developed
	these games can only be a guessing game at best, because how can we know
	which PC-98 model ZUN actually developed the games on? There might even be
	more than one model, especially when it comes to TH01 which had been in
	development for at least two years before ZUN first sold it. It's also not
	like any current PC-98 emulator even claims to emulate the specific timing
	of any existing model, and I sure hope that nobody expects me to import a
	bunch of bulky obsolete hardware just to count dropped frames.
</p><p>
	That leaves the tearing, where it's much more obvious how it's a bug. On an
	infinitely fast PC-98, the <i lang='ja' style='color: red'>ド﻿カ﻿ー﻿ン</i>
	frame would never be visible, and thus falls into the same category as the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-01-31" "two unused animations in the Sariel fight"}}.
	With only a single unconditional 2-frame delay inside the animation loop, it
	becomes clear that ZUN intended both frames of the animation to be displayed
	for 2 frames each:
</p><figure {{$vid_ドカーン.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_ドカーン}}
	<figcaption>No tearing, and 34 frames in total for the first of the two
	instances of this animation.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	<a class="release" href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/releases/tag/P0239">
	{{HTML_Emoji "th01"}} TH01 Anniversary Edition, version P0239</a>
	{{HTML_Download .HostedPath $dl}}
</p><p>
	Next up: Taking the oldest still undelivered push and working towards TH04
	position independence in preparation for multilingual translations. The
	Shuusou Gyoku OpenGL backend shouldn't take <i>that</i> much longer either,
	so I should have lots of stuff coming up in May afterward.
