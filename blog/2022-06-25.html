<p>
	The positive:
</p><ul>
	<li>It only took a record-breaking 1Â½ pushes to get SinGyoku done!</li>
	<li>No {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "entity synchronization code"}} after
	all! Since all of SinGyoku's sprites are 96Ã—96 pixels, ZUN made the rather
	smart decision of just using the sphere entity's position to render the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-12" "flash and person entities"}} â€“ and their only
	appearance is encapsulated in a single sphereâ†’personâ†’sphere transformation
	function.</li>
	<li>Just like Kikuri, SinGyoku's code as a whole is not a complete
	disaster.</li>
</ul><p>
	The negative:
</p><ul>
	<li>It's still exactly as buggy as Kikuri, with both of the ZUN bugs being
	rendering glitches in a single function once again.</li>
	<li>It also happens to come with a weird hitbox, â€¦</li>
	<li>â€¦ and some minor questionable and weird pieces of code.</li>
</ul><p>
	The overview:
</p><ul>
	<li>SinGyoku's fight consists of 2 phases, with the first one corresponding
	to the white part from 8 to 6 HP, and the second one to the rest of the HP
	bar. The distinction between the red-white and red parts is purely visual,
	and doesn't reflect anything about the boss script.</li>
	<li>Both phases cycle between a pellet pattern and SinGyoku's sphere form
	slamming itself into the player, followed by it slightly overshooting its
	intended base Y position on its way back up.</li>
	<li>Phase 1 only consists of the sphere form's half-circle spray pattern.
	Technically, the phase can only end <i>during</i> that pattern, but adding
	that one additional condition to allow it to end during the slam+return
	"pattern" wouldn't have made a difference anyway. The code doesn't rule out
	negative HP during the slam (have fun in test or debug mode), but the sum of
	invincibility frames alone makes it impossible to hit SinGyoku 7 times
	during a single slam in regular gameplay.</li>
	<li>Phase 2 features two patterns for both the female and male forms
	respectively, which are selected randomly.</li>
	<li>That's it â€“ no hidden timeouts nor {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "test/debug mode heap corruption susceptibility"}}.</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	This time, we're back to the Orb hitbox being a logical 49Ã—49 pixels in
	SinGyoku's center, and the shot hitbox being the weird one. What happens if
	you want the shot hitbox to be <i>both</i> offset to the left a bit
	<i>and</i> stretch the entire width of SinGyoku's sprite? You get a hitbox
	that ends in mid-air, far away from the right edge of the sprite:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid1}}
	<figcaption>
		Due to VRAM byte alignment, all player shots fired between
		<code>gx&nbsp;= 376</code> and <code>gx&nbsp;= 383</code> inclusive
		appear at the same visual X position, but are internally already partly
		outside the hitbox and therefore won't hit SinGyoku â€“ compare the
		marked shot at <code>gx&nbsp;= 376</code> to the one at <code>gx&nbsp;=
		380</code>. So much for precisely visualizing hitboxes in this gameâ€¦
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Since the female and male forms also use the sphere entity's coordinates,
	they share the same hitbox.
</p><hr /><p>
	Onto the rendering glitches then, which can â€“ you guessed it â€“ all be found
	in the sphere form's slam movement:
</p><ul>
	<li>ZUN unblits the delta area between the sphere's previous and current
	position on every frame, but reblits the sphere itself onâ€¦ only every second
	frame?</li>
	<li>For negative X velocities, ZUN made a typo and subtracted the Y velocity
	from the right edge of the area to be unblitted, rather than adding the X
	velocity. On a cursory look, this shouldn't affect the game all <i>too</i>
	much due to the unblitting function's word alignment. Except when it does:
	If the Y velocity is much smaller than the X one, the left edge of the
	unblitted area can, on certain frames, easily align to a word address past
	the previous right edge of the sphere. As a result, not a single sphere
	pixel will actually be unblitted, and a small stripe of the sphere will be
	left in VRAM for one frame, until the alignment has caught up with the
	sphere's movement in the next one.</li>
</ul>
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid2}}
	<figcaption>
		By having the sphere move from the right edge of the playfield to the
		left, this video demonstrates both the lazy reblitting and broken
		unblitting at the right edge for negative X velocities. Also, isn't it
		funny how Reimu can partly disappear from all the sloppy
		SinGyoku-related unblitting going on after her sprite was blitted?
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Due to the low contrast of the sphere against the background, you typically
	don't notice these glitches, but the white invincibility flashing after a
	hit really does draw attention to them. This time, all of these glitches
	aren't even directly <i>caused</i> by ZUN having never learned about the
	EGC's bit length register â€“ if he just wrote correct code for SinGyoku, none
	of this would have been an issue. Sighâ€¦ I wonder how many more glitches will
	be caused by improper use of this one function in the last 18% of
	<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>.
</p><p>
	There's even another bug here, with ZUN hardcoding a horizontal delta of 8
	pixels rather than just passing the actual X velocity. Luckily, the maximum
	movement speed is 6 pixels on Lunatic, and this would have only turned into
	an additional observable glitch if the X velocity were to exceed 24 pixels.
	But that just means it's the kind of bug that still drains RE attention to
	prove that you <i>can't</i> actually observe it in-game under <i>some</i>
	circumstances.
</p><hr /><p>
	The 5 pellet patterns are all pretty straightforward, with nothing to talk
	about. The code architecture during phase 2 does hint towards ZUN having had
	more creative patterns in mind â€“ especially for the male form, which uses
	the transformation function's three pattern callback slots for three
	repetitions of the same pellet group.<br />
	There is one more oddity to be found at the very end of the fight:
</p><figure class="pixelated">
	<img src="{{$pic}}" alt="The first frame of TH01 SinGyoku's defeat animation, showing the sphere blitted on top of a potentially active person form" />
</figure><p>
	Right before the defeat white-out animation, the sphere form is explicitly
	reblitted for no reason, on top of the form that was blitted to VRAM in the
	previous frame, and regardless of which form is currently active. If
	SinGyoku was meant to immediately transform back to the sphere form before
	being defeated, why isn't the person form unblitted before then? Therefore,
	the visibility of both forms is undeniably canon, and there is <i>some</i>
	lore meaning to be found hereâ€¦ {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}<br />
	In any case, that's SinGyoku done! 6<sup>th</sup> PC-98 Touhou boss fully
	decompiled, 25 remaining.
</p><hr /><p>
	No <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> code rounding out the last push for a change, as
	the {{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-08" "remaining missile code"}} has been
	waiting in front of SinGyoku for a while. It already looked bad in November,
	but the angle-based sprite selection function definitely takes the cake when
	it comes to unnecessary and decadent floating-point abuse in this game.
	<br />
	The algorithm itself is very trivial: Even with
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-27" ".PTN requiring an additional <code>quarter</code> parameter to access 16Ã—16 sprites"}},
	it's essentially just one bit shift, one addition, and one binary
	<code>AND</code>. For whatever reason though, ZUN casts the 8-bit missile
	angle into a 64-bit <code>double</code>, which turns the following explicit
	comparisons (!) against all possible <span class="hovertext"
	title="32Ã—32 sprite">4</span> + <span class="hovertext"
	title="16Ã—16 quarter inside the 32Ã—32 sprite">16</span> boundary angles (!!)
	into FPU operations. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Even with naive and readable
	division and modulo operations, and the whole existence of this function not
	playing well with Turbo C++ 4.0J's terrible code generation at all, this
	could have been 3 lines of code and 35 un-inlined constant-time
	instructions. Instead, we've got this 207-instruction monsterâ€¦ but hey, at
	least it works. ðŸ¤·<br />
	The remaining time then went to YuugenMagan's initialization code, which
	allowed me to immediately remove more declarations from ASM land, but more
	on that once we get to the rest of that boss fight.
</p><p>
	That leaves 76 functions until we're done with TH01! Next up: Card-flipping
	stage obstacles.
