	Let's start right with the milestones:
</p><ul>
	<li>More than 50% of all PC-98 Touhou game code has now been
	reverse-engineered! 🎉 While this number isn't equally distributed among the
	games, we've got one game very close to 100% and reverse-engineered most of
	the core features of two others. During the last 32 months of continuous
	funding, I've averaged an overall speed of 1.11% total RE per month. That
	looks like a decent prediction of how much more time it will take for 100%
	across all games – unless, of course, I'd get to work towards some of the
	non-RE goals in the meantime.</li>
	<li>70 functions left in TH01, with less than 10,000 ASM instructions
	remaining! Due to immense hype, I've temporarily raised the cap by 50% until
	August 15. With the last TH01 pushes delivering at roughly 1.5× of the
	currently calculated average speed, that should be more than enough to get
	TH01 done – especially since I expect YuugenMagan to come with lots of
	redundant code. Therefore, please also request a secondary priority for
	these final TH01 RE contributions.</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	So, how did this card-flipping stage obstacle delivery get so horribly
	delayed? With all the different layouts showcased in the 28 card-flipping
	stages, you'd expect this to be among the more stable and bug-free parts of
	the codebase. Heck, with all stage objects being placed on a 32×32-pixel
	grid, this is the first TH01-related blog post this year that doesn't have
	to describe an alignment-related unblitting glitch!
</p><p>
	That alone doesn't mean that this code is free from quirky behavior though,
	and we have to look no further than the first few lines of the collision
	handling for round bumpers to already find a whole lot of that. Simplified,
	they do the following:
</p><pre>pixel_t delta_y_between_orb_and_bumper = (orb.top - bumper.top);
if(delta_y_between_orb_and_bumper <= 0) {
	orb.top = (bumper.top - 24);
} else {
	orb.top = (bumper.top + 24);
}</pre><p>
	Immediately, you wonder why these assignments only exist for the Y
	coordinate. Sure, hitting a bumper from the left or right side should happen
	less often, but it's definitely possible. Is it really a good idea to warp
	the Orb to the top or bottom edge of a bumper regardless?<br />
	What's more important though: The fact that these immediate assignments
	exist at all. The game's regular Orb physics work by producing a Y velocity
	from the single force acting on the Orb and a gravity factor, and are
	completely independent of its current Y position. A bumper collision does
	also apply a new force onto the Orb further down in the code, but these
	assignments still bypass the physics system and are bound to have
	<i>some</i> knock-on effect on the Orb's movement.
</p><p>
	To observe that effect, we just have to enter Stage 18 on the <span
	lang="ja">地獄</span>/Jigoku route, where it's particularly trivial to
	reproduce. At a {{Blog_PostLink "2020-06-13" "horizontal velocity"}} of ±4,
	these assignments are <i>exactly</i> what can cause the Orb to endlessly
	bounce between two bumpers. As rudimentary as the Orb's physics may be, just
	letting them do their work would have entirely prevented these loops:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<div class="multilayer" style="aspect-ratio: 2 / 1;">
		<video id="{{.Date}}-b2-0" controls loop class="active">
			{{$vid_b2_0.Body}}
		</video>
		<video id="{{.Date}}-b2-1" controls loop>{{$vid_b2_1.Body}}</video>
	</div>
	<figcaption>
		<p>
			<div id="{{.Date}}-b2-controls"></div>
			<div id="{{.Date}}-b2"></div>
		</p>
		<span id="{{.Date}}-b2-caption"></span> The blue areas indicate the
		<span class="hovertext" title="Within the usual caveat of the Orb's internal X position not corresponding to its on-screen one, as it's blitted on the byte-aligned 8×1-pixel VRAM grid.">pixel-perfect*</span>
		hitboxes of each bumper.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Now, you might be thinking that these Y assignments were just an attempt to
	prevent the Orb from colliding with the same bumper again on the next frame.
	After all, those 24 pixels exactly correspond to ⅓ of the height of a
	bumper's hitbox with an additional pixel added on top. However, the game
	already perfectly prevents repeated collisions by turning off collision
	testing with the same bumper for the next 7 frames after a collision. Thus,
	we can conclude that ZUN either explicitly coded bumper collision handling
	to facilitate these loops, or just didn't take out that code after
	inevitably discovering what it did. This is not janky code, it's not a
	glitch, it's not sarcasm from my end, and it's not the game's physics being
	bad.
</p><p>
	But wait. Couldn't these assignments just be a remnant from a time in
	development <i>before</i> ZUN decided on the 7-frame delay on further
	collisions? Well, even that explanation stops holding water after the next
	few lines of code. Simplified, again:
</p><pre>pixel_t delta_x_between_orb_and_bumper = (orb.left - bumper.left);
if((orb.velocity.x == +4) && (delta_x_between_orb_and_bumper < 0)) {
	orb.velocity.x = -4;
} else if((orb.velocity.x == -4) && (delta_x_between_orb_and_bumper > 0)) {
	orb.velocity.x = +4;
}
</pre><p>
	What's important here is the part that's <i>not</i> in the code – namely,
	anything that handles X velocities of -8 or +8. In those cases, the Orb
	simply continues in the same horizontal direction. The manual Y assignment
	is the only part of the code that actually prevents a collision there, as
	the newly applied force is not guaranteed to be enough:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<div class="multilayer" style="aspect-ratio: 2 / 1;">
		<video id="{{.Date}}-b3-0" controls loop class="active">
			{{$vid_b3_0.Body}}
		</video>
		<video id="{{.Date}}-b3-1" controls loop>{{$vid_b3_1.Body}}</video>
	</div>
	<figcaption>
		<p>
			<div id="{{.Date}}-b3-controls"></div>
			<div id="{{.Date}}-b3"></div>
		</p>
		<span id="{{.Date}}-b3-caption"></span>
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Forgetting to handle ⅖ of your discrete X velocity cases is simply not
	something you do by accident. So we might as well say that ZUN deliberately
	designed the game to behave exactly as it does in this regard.
</p><hr /><p>
	Bumpers also come in vertical or horizontal bar shapes. Their collision
	handling also turns off further collision testing for the next 7 frames, and
	doesn't do any manual coordinate assignment. That's definitely a step up in
	cleanliness from round bumpers, but it doesn't seem to keep in mind that the
	player can fire a new shot every 4 frames when standing still. That makes it
	immediately obvious why this works:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video id="{{.Date}}-hbar" controls loop>{{$vid_hbar.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption>
		<p id="{{.Date}}-hbar-controls"></p>
		The <span style="color:green">green numbers</span> show the amount of
		frames since the last detected collision with the respective bumper bar,
		and indicate that collision testing with the bar below is currently
		disabled.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	That's the most well-known case of reducing the Orb's horizontal velocity to
	0 by exactly hitting it with shots in its center and then button-mashing it
	through a horizontal bar. This also works with vertical bars and yields even
	more interesting results there, but if we want to have any chance of
	understanding what happens there, we have to first go over some basics:
</p><ul>
	<li>Collision detection for all stage obstacles is done in <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row-major
	order</a> from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the
	playfield.</li>
	<li>All obstacles are collision-tested independently from each other, with
	the collision response code immediately following the test.</li>
	<li>The hitboxes for bumper bars extend far past their 32×32 sprites to make
	sure that the Orb can collide with them from any side. They are a
	pixel-perfect* 87×56 pixels for horizontal bars, and 57×87 pixels for
	vertical ones. Yes, that's no typo, they really do differ in one pixel.</li>
	<li>Changing the Y velocity during such a collision just involves applying a
	new force with the magnitude of the negated current Y velocity, which can be
	done multiple times during a frame without changing the result. This
	explains why the force is correctly inverted in the clip above, despite the
	Orb colliding with two bumpers simultaneously.</li>
	<li>Lacking a similar force system, the X coordinate is simply directly
	inverted.</li>
</ul><p>
	However, if that were everything the game did, kicking the Orb into a column
	of vertical bumper bars would lead them to behave more like a rope that the
	Orb can climb, as the initial collision with two hitboxes cancels out the
	intended sign change that reflects the Orb away from the bars:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video id="{{.Date}}-rope" controls loop>{{$vid_rope.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption>
		<p id="{{.Date}}-rope-controls"></p>
		This footage was recorded without the workaround I am about to describe.
		It does not reflect the behavior of the original game. <strong>You
		cannot do this in the original game.</strong><br />
		While the visualization reveals small sections where three hitboxes
		overlap, the Orb can never actually collide with three of them at the
		same time, as those 3-hitbox regions are 2 pixels smaller than they
		would need to be to fit the Orb. That's exactly the difference between
		using <code>&lt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;=</code> in these hitbox
		comparisons.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	While that would have been a fun gameplay mechanic on its own, it
	immediately breaks apart once you place two vertical bumper bars next to
	each other. Due to <i>how</i> these bumper bar hitboxes extend past their
	sprites, any two adjacent vertical bars would exactly share one and the same
	hitbox. Stage 17 on the <span class="ja">魔﻿界</span>/Makai route contains
	exactly such a layout:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video id="{{.Date}}-fall" controls loop>{{$vid_fall.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption>
		<p id="{{.Date}}-fall-controls"></p>
		The collision handlers of adjacent vertical bars always activate in the
		same frame, independently invert the Orb's X velocity, and therefore
		fully cancel out their intended effect on the Orb… if the game did not
		have the workaround I am about to describe. <strong>This cannot happen
		in the original game.</strong>
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	ZUN's workaround: Setting a "vertical bumper bar block flag" after any
	collision with such a bar, which simply disables <i>any</i> collision with
	<i>any</i> vertical bar for the next 7 frames. This quick hack made all
	vertical bars work as intended, and avoided the need for involving the Orb's
	X velocity in any kind of physics system. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	With that, we can now try mashing the Orb into these two vertical bars:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video id="{{.Date}}-vbar" controls loop>{{$vid_vbar.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption id="{{.Date}}-vbar-controls"></figcaption>
</figure><p>
	At first, that workaround doesn't seem to make a difference here. As we
	expect, the frame numbers now tell us that only one of the two bumper bars
	in a row activates, but we couldn't have told otherwise as the number of
	bars has no effect on newly applied Y velocity forces. On a closer look, the
	Orb's rise to the top of the playfield is in fact <i>caused</i> by that
	workaround though, combined with the unchanged top-to-bottom order of
	collision testing. As soon as <i>any</i> bumper bar completed its 7
	collision delay frames, it resets the aforementioned flag, which already
	reactivates collision handling for any remaining vertical bumper bars during
	the same frame. Look out for <a href='#{{.Date}}-vbar'
	onclick='_2022_07_10_vbar.currentTime = 2.836;'>frames with both a <span
	style="color: green;">7</span> and a <span style="color:
	green;">1</span></a>: The <span style="color: green;">7</span> will always
	appear <i>before</i> the <span style="color: green;">1</span> in the
	row-major order. Whenever this happens, the current oscillation period is
	cut down from 7 to 6 frames – and because collision testing runs from top to
	bottom, this will always happen during the falling part. Depending on the Y
	velocity, the rising part may also be cut down to 6 frames from time to
	time, but that one at least has a <i>chance</i> to last for the full 7
	frames. This difference adds those crucial extra frames of upward movement,
	which add up to send the Orb to the top. Without the flag, you'd always see
	the Orb oscillating between a fixed range of the bar column.<br />
	Finally, it's the "top of playfield" force that gradually slows down the Orb
	and makes sure it ultimately only moves at sub-pixel velocities, which have
	no visible effect. Because
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-06-13" "the regular effect of gravity"}} is reset with
	each newly applied force, it's completely negated during most of the climb.
	This even holds true once the Orb reached the top: Since the Orb requires a
	negative force to repeatedly arrive up there and be bounced back, this force
	will stay active for the first 5 of the 7 collision frames and not move the
	Orb at all. Once gravity kicks in at the 5<sup>th</sup> frame and adds 1 to
	the Y velocity, it's already too late: The new velocity can't be larger than
	0﻿.﻿5, and the Orb only has 1 or 2 frames before the flag reset causes it to
	be bounced back up to the top again.
</p><hr /><p>
	Portals, on the other hand, turn out to be much simpler than the <a
	href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/index.php?title=Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers%2FGameplay&type=revision&diff=56492&oldid=56491">old
	description that ended up on Touhou Wiki in October 2005</a> might suggest.
	Everything about their teleportations is random: The destination portal, the
	exit force (as an integer between -9 and +9), as well as the exit X
	velocity, with each of the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-06-13" "5 distinct horizontal velocities"}} having an
	equal chance of being chosen. Of course, if the destination portal is next
	to the left or right edge of the playfield and it chooses to fire the Orb
	towards that edge, it immediately bounces off into the opposite direction,
	whereas the 0 velocity is always selected with a constant 20% probability.
</p><p>
	The selection process for the destination portal involves a bit more than a
	single <code>rand()</code> call. The game bundles all obstacles in a single
	structure of dynamically allocated arrays, and only knows how many obstacles
	there are <i>in total</i>, not per type. Now, that alone wouldn't have much
	of an impact on random portal selection, as you could simply roll a random
	obstacle ID and try again if it's not a portal. But just to be extra cute,
	ZUN instead iterates over all obstacles, selects any non-entered portal with
	a chance of ¼, and just gives up if that dice roll wasn't successful after
	16 loops over the whole array, defaulting to the entered portal in that
	case.<br />
	In all its silliness though, this works perfectly fine, and results in a
	chance of 0.75<sup>16(𝑛&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)</sup> for the Orb exiting out of the
	same portal it entered, with 𝑛 being the total number of portals in a
	stage. That's 1% for two portals, and 0.01% for three. Pretty decent for a
	random result you don't want to happen, but that hurts nobody if it does.
</p><p>
	The one tiny ZUN bug with portals is technically not even part of the newly
	decompiled code here. If Reimu gets hit while the Orb is being sent through
	a portal, the Orb is immediately kicked out of the portal it entered, no
	matter whether it already shows up inside the sprite of the destination
	portal. Neither of the two portal sprites is reset when this happens,
	leading to "two Orbs" being visible simultaneously.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}<br />
	This makes very little sense no matter how you look at it. The Orb doesn't
	receive a new velocity or force when this happens, so it will simply
	re-enter the same portal once the gameplay resumes on Reimu's next life:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video id="{{.Date}}-p" controls loop>{{$vid_p.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption id="{{.Date}}-p-controls"></figcaption>
</figure><p>
	And that's it! At least the turrets don't have anything notable to say about
	them {{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-30" "that I haven't said before"}}.
</p><hr /><p>
	That left another ½ of a push over at the end. Way too much time to finish
	<code>FUUIN.exe</code>, way too little time to start with Mima… but the bomb
	animation fit perfectly in there. No secrets or bugs there, just a bunch of
	sprite animation code wasting at least another 82 bytes in the data segment.
	The special effect after the kuji-in sprites uses the same single-bitplane
	32×32 square inversion effect seen at the end of Kikuri's and Sariel's
	entrance animation, except that it's a 3-stack of 16-rings moving at 6, 7,
	and 8 pixels per frame respectively. At these comparatively slow speeds, the
	byte alignment of each square adds some further noise to the discoloration
	pattern… if you even notice it below all the shaking and seizure-inducing
	hardware palette manipulation.<br />
	And yes, due to the very destructive nature of the effect, the game does in
	fact rely on it only being applied to VRAM page 0. While that will cause
	every moving sprite to tear holes into the inverted squares along its
	trajectory, keeping a clean playfield on VRAM page 1 is what allows all that
	pixel damage to be easily undone at the end of this 89-frame animation.
</p><p>
	Next up: Mima! Let's hope that stage obstacles already were the most complex
	part remaining in TH01…
