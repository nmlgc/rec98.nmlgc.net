animation	Colorful, crisp images that are played in a sequence.
blitting	Getting pixel data to and from VRAM.
bomb	Limited-use item that damages enemies and grants temporary invulnerability, while playing a flashy animation specific to the player character.

bullet	Projectiles fired by enemies.
card-flipping	TH01's regular, non-boss stages.
contribution-ideas	Potential improvements that volunteers could meaningfully contribute to this project. Mostly minor issues, or slightly out of scope of the main project.

danmaku-pattern	A complete danmaku animation over a specified period of time.
dosbox-x	A DOSBox fork with support for PC-98 emulation.
enemy	Common stage enemies with simple scripts, in contrast to midbosses or bosses.

menu	Any window offering multiple options to be selected or configured.
meta	Thoughts and news about this entire project.
micro-optimization	Needlessly complicated code, achieving minimal performance gains at the cost of maintainability.
midboss	A single bigger enemy with a slightly more complicated, hardcoded script, occasionally fought halfway through a stage.

palette	Manipulation of the PC-98's 16-color palette for graphics.
pc98	Details on PC-98 hardware and software.

pipeline	Additional, helpful code generation steps, beyond regular compiler/assembler invocations.
player	Player-controlled characters.
portability	Notes about future ports of the games away from x86 and the PC-98 platform.
position-independence	Reducing the number of unlabeled memory references, to make life easier for modders. Also a requirement for using any other compiler on the reconstructed source code.

tcc	Discoveries about Turbo C++ 4.0J, the C++ compiler ZUN originally used for PC-98 Touhou.
thief	Things that ZUN stole from others, without crediting them.
unused	Unused remnants of code. Might tell something about a game's development history.
uth05win	Open-source Windows rewrite of TH05, based on reverse-engineered code from the original. Slightly inaccurate in places, but overall still a great help for this project.
waste	Consuming memory or disk space for no reason, or wrong reasons. Decent optimization opportunities for mods.
