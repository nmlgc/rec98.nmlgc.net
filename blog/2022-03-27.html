	Did you know that moving on top of a boss sprite doesn't kill the player in
	TH04, only in TH05?

	That's the first of only three interesting discoveries in these 3 pushes,
	all of which concern TH04. But yeah, 3 for something as seemingly simple as
	these shared boss functions… that's still not quite the speed-up I had hoped
	for. While most of this can be blamed, again, on TH04 and all of its
	hardcoded complexities, there still was a lot of work to be done on the
	maintenance front as well.  These functions reference a bunch of code I RE'd
	years ago and that still had to be brought up to current standards, with the
	dependencies reaching from {{Blog_PostLink "2019-03-06" "boss explosions"}}
	over {{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-04" "text RAM overlay functionality"}} up to
	in-game dialog loading.

	The latter provides a good opportunity to talk a bit about <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation">x86 memory
	segmentation</a>. Many aspiring PC-98 developers these days are very scared
	of it, with some even going as far as to rather mess with Protected Mode and
	DOS extenders just so that they don't have to deal with it. I wonder where
	that fear comes from… Could it be because every modern programming language
	I know of assumes memory to be flat, and lacks any standard language-level
	features to even express something like segments and offsets? That's why
	compilers have a hard time targeting 16-bit x86 these days: Doing anything
	interesting on the architecture <i>requires</i> giving the programmer full
	control over segmentation, which <i>always</i> comes down to adding the
	typical non-standard language extensions of compilers from back in the day.
	And as soon as DOS stopped being used, these extensions no longer made sense
	and were subsequently removed from newer tools. A good example for this can
	be found in an <a
	href="https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/cse3101/nasmdoc1.html">old version of the
	NASM manual</a>: The project started as an attempt to make x86 assemblers
	simple again by throwing out most of the segmentation features from
	MASM-style assemblers, which made complete sense in 1996 when 16-bit DOS and
	Windows were already on their way out. But there <i>was</i> a point to all
	those features, and that's why ReC98 still has to use the supposedly
	inferior TASM.
</p><p>
	Not that this fear of segmentation is completely unfounded: All the
	segmentation-related keywords, directives, and <code>#pragma</code>s
	provided by Borland C++ and TASM absolutely <i>can</i> be the cause of many
	weird runtime bugs. Even if the compiler or linker catches them, you are
	often left with confusing error messages that aged just as poorly as memory
	segmentation itself.<br>
	However, embracing the concept does provide quite the opportunity for
	optimizations. While it definitely was a very crazy idea, there is a small
	bit of brilliance to be gained from making proper use of all these
	segmentation features. Case in point: The buffer for the in-game dialog
	scripts in TH04 and TH05.
</p><pre>// Thanks to the semantics of `far` pointers, we only need a single 32-bit
// pointer variable for the following code.
extern unsigned char far *dialog_p;

// This master.lib function returns a `void __seg *`, which is a 16-bit
// segment-only pointer. Converting to a `far *` yields a full segment:offset
// pointer to offset 0000h of that segment.
dialog_p = (unsigned char far *)hmem_allocbyte(/* … */);

// Running the dialog script involves pointer arithmetic. On a far pointer,
// this only affects the 16-bit offset part, complete with overflow at 64 KiB,
// from FFFFh back to 0000h.
dialog_p += /* … */;
dialog_p += /* … */;
dialog_p += /* … */;

// Since the segment part of the pointer is still identical to the one we
// allocated above, we can later correctly free the buffer by pulling the
// segment back out of the pointer.
hmem_free((void __seg *)dialog_p);</pre><p>
	If <code>dialog_p</code> was a <code>huge</code> pointer, any pointer
	arithmetic would have also adjusted the segment part, requiring a second
	pointer to store the base address for the <code>hmem_free</code> call. Doing
	that will also be necessary for any port to a flat memory model. Depending
	on how you look at it, this compression of two logical pointers into a
	single variable is either quite nice, or really, <i>really</i> dumb in its
	reliance on the precise memory model of one single architecture.

</p><hr><p>
	Why look at dialog loading though, wasn't this supposed to be all about
	shared boss functions? Well, TH04 unnecessarily puts certain stage-specific
	code into the boss defeat function, such as loading the alternate Stage 5
	Yuuka defeat dialog before a Bad Ending, or initializing Gengetsu after
	Mugetsu's defeat in the Extra Stage.<br>
	That's TH04's second core function with an explicit conditional branch for
	Gengetsu, after the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-29" "dialog exit code we found last year during EMS research"}}.
	And I've heard people say that Shinki was the most hardcoded fight in PC-98
	Touhou… Really, Shinki is a perfectly regular boss, who makes proper use of
	all internal mechanics in the way they were intended, and doesn't blast
	holes into the architecture of the game. Even within TH05, it's Mai and Yuki
	who rely on hacks and duplicated code, not Shinki.
</p><p>
	The worst part about this though? How the function distinguishes Mugetsu
	from Gengetsu. Once again, it uses its own global variable to track whether
	it is called the first or the second time within TH04's Extra Stage,
	unrelated to the same variable used in the dialog exit function. But this
	time, it's not just any newly created, single-use variable, oh no. In a
	misguided attempt to micro-optimize away a few bytes of conventional memory,
	TH04 reserves 16 bytes of "generic boss state", which can (and are) freely
	used for anything a boss doesn't want to store in a more dedicated
	variable.<br>
	It might have been worth it if the bosses actually <i>used</i> most of these
	16 bytes, but the majority just use (the same) two, with only Stage 4 Reimu
	using a whopping seven different ones. To reverse-engineer the various uses
	of these variables, I pretty much had to map out which of the undecompiled
	{{HTML_TagInline "danmaku-pattern"}} functions corresponds to which boss
	fight. In the end, I assigned 29 different variable names for each of the
	semantically different use cases, which made up another full push on its
	own.
</p><p>
	Now, 16 bytes of wildly shared state, isn't that the perfect recipe for
	bugs? At least during this cursory look, I haven't found any obvious ones
	yet. If they do exist, it's more likely that they involve reused state from
	earlier bosses – just how the <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1k82w1VzUc">Shinki death glitch in
	TH05 is caused by reusing cheeto data from way back in Stage 4</a> – and
	hence require much more boss-specific progress.<br>
	And yes, it might have been way too early to look into all these tiny
	details of specific boss scripts… but then, this happened:
</p><figure class="pixelated"><a
	href="{{$pic2}}"><img src="{{$pic2}}" alt="TH04 crashing to the DOS prompt in the Stage 4 Marisa fight, right as the last of her bits is destroyed"></a>
</figure><p>
	Looks similar to <a
	href="https://github.com/spaztron64/th98tuc_site/issues/11">another
	screenshot of a crash in the same fight that was reported in December</a>,
	doesn't it? I was too much in a hurry to figure it out exactly, but notice
	how both crashes happen right as the last of Marisa's four <span
	class="hovertext" title="Yes, ビット is the correct technical term for
	those, according to OMAKE.TXT.">bits</span> is destroyed.
	{{DB_CustomerByID 11}} has <a
	href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/User:KirbyComment/Lotus_Land_Story_Info#Divide_Error_Crash">suspected
	this to be the cause for a while</a>, and now I can pretty much confirm it
	to be an unguarded division by the number of on-screen bits in
	Marisa-specific pattern code. But what's the cause for Kurumi then?
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}<br>
	As for fixing it, I can go for either a fast or a slow option:
</p><ol>
	<li>Superficially fixing only this crash will probably just take a fraction
	of a push.</li>
	<li>But I could also go for a deeper understanding by looking at TH04's
	version of the {{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-29" "custom entity structure"}}. It
	not only stores the data of Marisa's bits, but is also very likely to be
	involved in Kurumi's crash, <i>and</i> would get TH04 a lot closer to 100%
	PI. Taking that look will probably need at least 2 pushes, and might require
	another 3-4 to completely decompile Marisa's fight, and 2-3 to decompile
	Kurumi's.</li>
</ol><hr><p>
	OK, now that that's out of the way, time to finish the boss defeat function…
	but not without stumbling over the third of TH04's quirks, relating to the
	Clear Bonus for the main game or the Extra Stage:
</p><ul>
	<li>To achieve the incremental addition effect for the in-game score display
	in the HUD, all new points are first added to a <code>score_delta</code>
	variable, which is then added to the actual score at a maximum rate of
	61,110 points per frame.</li>
	<li>There are a fixed 416 frames between showing the score tally and
	launching into <code>MAINE.EXE</code>.</li>
	<li>As a result, TH04's Clear Bonus is effectively limited to
	(416&nbsp;×&nbsp;61,110)&nbsp;=&nbsp;25,421,760 points.</li>
	<li>Only TH05 makes sure to commit the entirety of the
	<code>score_delta</code> to the actual score before switching binaries,
	which fixes this issue.</li>
</ul><p>
	And after another few collision-related functions, we're now <i>truly</i>,
	finally ready to decompile bosses in both TH04 and TH05! Just as the
	<i>anything</i> funds were running out… {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} The
	remaining ¼ of the third push then went to Shinki's 32×32 ball bullets,
	rounding out this delivery with a small self-contained piece of the first
	TH05 boss we're probably going to look at.
</p><p>
	Next up, though: I'm not sure, actually. Both Shinki and Elis seem just a
	little bit larger than the 2¼ or 4 pushes purchased so far, respectively.
	Now that there's a bunch of room left in the cap again, I'll just let the
	next contribution decide – with a preference for Shinki in case of a tie.
	And if it will take longer than usual for the store to sell out again this
	time (heh), there's still the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-09-12" "PC-98 text RAM JIS trail word rendering research"}}
	waiting to be documented.
