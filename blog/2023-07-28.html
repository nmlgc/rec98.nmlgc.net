<p>
	Yet another small interruption before we get to Shuusou Gyoku, but only
	because I've got a big announcement to make! {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} has just
	commissioned the basic feature set that would allow PC-98 Touhou to be
	translated into non-ASCII languages. üí∞ And we're in fact doing it on PC-98,
	and don't wait for the games to be ported to other systems first.
</p><h5>How is this going to work?</h5><p>
	This project will start sometime after I've completed the current big
	project of <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/42">porting Shuusou
	Gyoku to Linux</a>, so probably in the last few months of 2023. Similar to
	the previous MediaWiki update, this will bypass the ReC98 push and cap
	model: {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} is going to guarantee a minimum budget out of
	their Open Collective funds, which can be increased with further donations
	from the community, and I'm going to send an invoice once I'm done. In
	addition, I'm also going to keep in contact with all interested translators
	and backers via a Discord room throughout the process for additional
	technical quality control.<br />
	Since ReC98 hasn't really focused on text so far, the amount of moddable
	text-related code would be fairly limited if I started working on it right
	away. Currently, it only includes the following:
</p><ul>
	<li>All of TH01</li>
	<li>All of TH02's <code>OP.EXE</code>, i.e., the main menu and the Music
	Room</li>
	<li>TH04's and TH05's endings</li>
</ul><p>
	Therefore, I'll put any general and unconstrained reverse-engineering,
	position independence, or <q>anything</q> contributions that come in during
	the next few months towards covering everything that's still missing there.
	I've scheduled the in-game dialog system of TH04 and TH05 for mid-August,
	after the next two Shuusou Gyoku-related deliveries, and here's what we'd
	still be missing afterward:
</p><ul>
	<li>TH02's dialog system has seen no RE done yet and is completely different
	from TH04's and TH05's, so we'd need another 2-3 pushes there. Technically,
	we'd also need <code>MAIN.EXE</code> to be 100% position-independent for any
	translation-related code modifications, but reaching that goal before I get
	to work on translation support is probably unrealistic. If I tackle this
	game last, I might figure out something to bypass that requirement.</li>
	<li>The Music Rooms of TH03, TH04, and TH05 need roughly 2 pushes for their
	combined RE and finalization. Most of their code is shared with TH02's Music
	Room which I decompiled back in 2015.</li>
	<li>TH02's <code>MAINE.EXE</code> needs to be fully RE'd since all of its
	screens contain translatable text. Due to its highly copy-pasted nature, it
	should be much cheaper than currently estimated on the main page. 3 pushes
	should be enough there, though.</li>
	<li>The main menu help strings in TH04's and TH05's <code>OP.EXE</code> are
	very conveniently located, and could be RE'd within 0.25 pushes at
	most.</li>
	<li>Similarly, TH04's and TH05's <code>MAINE.EXE</code> contains some not
	yet RE'd text in their verdict screens. 1 push there, since it's
	unfortunately contained in the same function that also performs the highly
	complex skill value calculation.</li>
	<li>TH03's <code>MAINL.EXE</code> needs 100% PI to enable translations of
	the Stage 8/9 cutscenes and endings, as well as a bit of RE for the
	end-of-stage text. Let's go with 1.75 pushes there just to be safe, rounding
	up the 0.25 above.</li>
	<li>TH03's <code>MAIN.EXE</code> has the <span lang="ja">Ôº∑Ôº©ÔºÆÔºÆÔº•Ôº≤
	Ôº¢ÔºØÔºÆÔºµÔº≥</span> popup as its only translatable text. Like TH02's
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code>, the entire binary should be position-independent
	before doing translations. Let's also do that last.</li>
</ul><p>
	In total, that's the next 11 general pushes that will go towards ensuring
	translatability of most of PC-98 Touhou, if possible. If you'd like your
	contribution (or existing subscription) to go to {{HTML_Tag "gameplay" nil}}
	code instead, be sure to tell me!
</p><h5>What's the minimum guaranteed set of features?</h5><p>
	The main feature will be a custom renderer for a subsetted, monospaced
	Unicode bitmap font, and its integration into any translatable part of the
	game. For the script files, this means UTF-8 support with Shift-JIS
	fallback. For the glyphs, I'll use <a
	href="https://unifoundry.com/unifont/">GNU Unifont</a> by default, but we
	could also use any other freely licensed bitmap font with 8√ó16 or 16√ó16
	glyphs for alphabets of certain languages. Everything about this will be the
	real deal: The system will potentially support all of Unicode without font
	ROM hacks so that the translations will work on real hardware, and there
	will be no shortcuts for just a few Latin characters. And if someone wants
	to translate this game into a language with <a
	href="https://twitter.com/cmuratori/status/1416978255584792579">more complex
	shaping rules</a>, I'll make sure that they look pretty as well if there's
	some budget left.<br />
	This will allow translation teams to build static translation patches into
	any language by editing the original script files, and using
	{{DB_CustomerByID 2}}'s <a href="http://lunarcast.net/mystictk.php">existing
	tools</a> for any images. Modifications of hardcoded strings would still
	require recompiling the binary, and each group would have to distribute and
	advertise the result on their own.

</p><ul>

	<li><b>Chinese, Traditional</b>: Haniyasuko Okina</li>
	<li><b>Croatian</b>: <a

</ul>
</p><h5>How much better could it be?</h5><ul>
	<li>The most important feature: We could finally move away from the concept
	of <i>translation patches</i>, integrate all translations as part of the
	ReC98 repo, and ship them directly as part of new ReC98 builds. Languages
	could then be switched at runtime, through a new setting in the Option
	menu.<ul>
		<li>And why stop there? How about binding a keyboard key to a new
		language selection window that can be opened at any point during the
		game, and even switches out any text that is currently shown on
		screen?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>I could <a
	href="https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap/issues/38">finally</a> translate a
	canon Touhou game via a <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext">gettext</a>-like dictionary
	system. This would allow modded source text to override translations, and
	even make it possible to translate mods as well.</li>
	<li>Ideally, all translators I get to work with are highly motivated and
	finish translating each game they start, so that we don't even have to think
	about <a
	href="https://www.thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:About#Patch_stacking">translation
	stacking</a>, but maybe we still should.</li>
	<li>We could use proportional fonts instead of aligning every glyph to the
	8√ó16 text RAM grid. Unlike the Windows Touhou games where proportional fonts
	are crucial because adding more text space would desync replays, they are
	not <i>that</i> important in PC-98 Touhou. With no replays to be desynced,
	we can arbitrarily add new boxes without worrying about the font.<ul>
		<li>However, supporting proportional fonts would make it possible to
		lift some of the text sprites into the custom font system, allowing
		their glyphs to be shared more easily across languages:<figure><figure
		class="side_by_side pixelated">
			<img src="{{$th03}}" alt="TH03's gaiji text." />
			<img src="{{$th05}}" alt="TH04's and TH05's SFT2.CDG, containing the image text used in the main menus." />
		</figure><figcaption>
			Some of the image text from TH03's, TH04's, and TH05's main menus.
			Turning these sprites into text so that translators won't have to
			manually shift pixels around may or may not be worth it.
		</figcaption></figure></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>On the topic of new text boxes: Automatic line and box breaks at word
	boundaries would completely remove the need for in-game proofreading.</li>
	<li>In-game TL notes‚Ä¶ nah, probably not. Where would we even put them in the
	original screen layout?</li>
	<li>Due to the continued interest in TH01's Anniversary Edition, any code
	modifications would be exclusive to a respective game's bugfixed
	<code>anniversary</code> branch ‚Äì i.e., any translated builds will be
	bundled with a growing number of fixes for issues in the original games that
	fall under <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#zun-bug">my
	current definition of <i>bugs</i></a>. This avoids a combinatorial explosion
	of the number of branches, merges, and releases I'd have to do. For a small
	amount of extra money though, I could merge them back to the ZUN
	bug-preserving <code>debloated</code> branch. And for a <i>lot</i> of extra
	money, I could reimplement everything on <code>master</code> while
	preserving the original memory layout of ZUN's original binaries. This would
	allow the translation-supporting binaries to be easily diffed against the
	original ones, and retain compatibility with existing hacks or cheat tables.
	The latter was already something that
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-05-29" "the Shuusou Gyoku community previously expected my recompiled builds to have"}}.</li>
	<li>Just like with <a href="/blog/tag/mod">all custom PC-98 Touhou game
	builds</a> I've shipped so far, you would install the translations by <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/releases/tag/P0234">manually dropping
	files into the game directory, or editing .HDI images using third-party
	tools</a>. I can make this step pretty much arbitrarily more user-friendly
	by writing nice installers that cover all imaginable setups and use
	cases.</li>
	<li>I could top off the project with some smaller, more intricate
	localizations that translators might request for certain languages. Most
	notably, this category would include any localization of TH01's
	<span lang="ja">Êù±Êñπ‚òÖÈùàÁï∞‰ºù</span>,
	<span style="color: red">STAGE #</span>, and
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> popups that goes beyond just
	fixing the Engrish.</li>
	<li>The previous static English patches from 2014 introduced quite a few
	fanfiction changes that have been interpreted as canon in the years since. I
	could write a blog post to highlight these, and also compare the translation
	as a whole with the more literal English translation we're likely to get
	this time around.</li>
	<li>Finally, if you all <i>really</i> want to, I could move all translatable
	content to the {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} interface, which would truly turn that
	site into the one central translation source for all canon Touhou games.
	Automatic updates won't be feasible before porting away the games from PC-98
	hardware, so the thpatch server would have to communicate with the ReC98
	repo via a GitHub webhook. This will be rather expensive though, as I'd also
	have to set up some kind of build/release CI for ReC98 first.</li>
</ul><p>
	You might remember most of this from
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-11-30" "my initial pitch back in November"}}, but I
	did have quite a bit of additional ideas since then.
</p><p>
	These features are mostly independent of each other, and it will be up to
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}} to pick a priority order. That's also where all of you
	could come in and influence this order with your donations. So it's closer
	to a traditional crowdfunding campaign with stretch goals, where the sky is
	the limit, than it is to the usual ReC98 model. And while there can be no
	fixed prices for any of the goals, you can be sure that anything you invest
	will improve the quality of the final product.

</p><p>
	From now on, this will be the only way of funding any translation-related
	goals; I've removed the respective options from the ReC98 order form.
	Looking forward to how many of these additional ideas I get to implement ‚Äì
	but, as always, please invest responsibly.

	Shuusou Gyoku finally coming this weekend.
