	More than three months without any reverse-engineering progress! It's been
	way too long. Coincidentally, we're at least back with a surprising 1.25% of
	overall RE, achieved within just 3 pushes. The ending script system is not
	only more or less the same in TH04 and TH05, but actually originated in
	TH03, where it's also used for the cutscenes before stages 8 and 9. This
	means that it was one of the final pieces of code shared between three of
	the four remaining games, which I got to decompile at roughly 3× the usual
	speed, or ⅓ of the price.<br>
	The only other bargains of this nature remain in <code>OP.EXE</code>. The
	Music Room is largely equivalent in all three remaining games as well, and
	the sound device selection, ZUN Soft logo screens, and main/option menus are
	the same in TH04 and TH05. A lot of that code is in the "technically RE'd
	but not yet decompiled" ASM form though, so it would shift Finalized% more
	significantly than RE%. Therefore, make sure to order the new
	<i>Finalization</i> option rather than <i>Reverse-engineering</i> if you
	want to make number go up.
</p>{{call .TOC}}<hr id="overview-{{.Date}}"><p>
	So, cutscenes. On the surface, the .TXT files look simple enough: You
	directly write the text that should appear on the screen into the file
	without any special markup, and add commands to define visuals, music, and
	other effects at any place within the script. Let's start with the basics of
	how text is rendered, which are the same in all three games:
</p><ul>
	<li>First off, the text area has a size of 480×64 pixels. This means that it
	does <i>not</i> correspond to the tiled area painted into TH05's
	<code>EDBK?.PI</code> images:<figure><img
		src="{{$area}}"
		alt="The text area of the TH03/TH04/TH05 cutscene system."
	><figcaption>
		The yellow area is designated for character names.
	</figcaption></figure></li>
	<li>Since the font weight can be customized, all text is rendered to VRAM.
	This also includes gaiji, despite them ignoring the font weight
	setting.</li>
	<li>The system supports automatic line breaks on a per-glyph basis, which
	move the text cursor to the beginning of the <span style="color:
	red">red</span> text area. This might seem like a piece of long-forgotten
	ancient wisdom at first, considering the absence of automatic line breaks in
	Windows Touhou. However, ZUN probably implemented it more out of pure
	necessity: Text in VRAM needs to be unblitted when starting a new box, which
	is way more straightforward and performant if you only need to worry
	about a fixed area.</li>
	<li>The system also automatically starts a new (key press-separated) text
	box after the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> line. However, the text cursor is
	also unconditionally moved to the top-left corner of the yellow <i>name</i>
	area when this happens, which is almost certainly not what you expect, given
	that automatic line breaks stay within the red area. A script author might
	as well add the necessary text box change commands manually, if you're
	forced to anticipate the automatic ones anyway…<br>
	Due to ZUN forgetting an unblitting call during the TH05 refactoring of the
	box background buffer, this feature is even completely broken in that game,
	as any new text will simply be blitted on top of the old one:<figure><img
		src="{{$th05_boxfeed}}"
		alt="The effects of relying on automatically added text boxes in TH05's cutscene system."
	><figcaption>
		Wait, why are we already talking about game-specific differences after
		all? Also, note how the ⏎ animation appears one line below where you'd
		expect it.
	</figcaption></figure></li>
	<li>Overall, the system is geared toward exclusively full-width text. As
	exemplified by the 2014 static English patches and the screenshots in this
	blog post, half-width text is <i>possible</i>, but comes with a lot of
	asterisks attached:<ul>
		<li>Each loop of the script interpreter starts by looking at the next
		byte to distinguish commands from text. However, this step also skips
		over every ASCII space and control character, i.e., every byte
		≤&nbsp;32. If you only intend to display full-width glyphs anyway, this
		sort of makes sense: You gain complete freedom when it comes to the
		physical layout of these script files, and it especially allows commands
		to be freely separated with spaces and line breaks for improved
		readability. Still, enforcing commands to be separated exclusively by
		line breaks might have been even better for readability, and would have
		freed up ASCII spaces for regular text…</li>
		<li>Non-command text is blindly processed and rendered two bytes at a
		time. The rendering function interprets these bytes as a Shift-JIS
		string, so you <i>can</i> use half-width characters here. While the
		second byte can even be an ASCII <code>0x20</code> space due to the
		parser's blindness, all half-width characters must still occur in pairs
		that can't be interrupted by commands:<figure><img
			src="{{$hw}}"
			alt="Issues with half-width text in the TH03/TH04/TH05 cutscene system."
			></figure></li>
		<li>As a workaround for at least the ASCII space issue, you can replace
		them with any of the <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shift_JIS&oldid=1118113512#Shift_JIS_byte_map">unassigned
		Shift-JIS lead bytes</a> – <code>0x80</code>, <code>0xA0</code>, or
		anything between <code>0xF0</code> and <code>0xFF</code> inclusive.
		That's what you see in all screenshots of this post that display
		half-width spaces.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Finally, did you know that you can hold <kbd>ESC</kbd> to fast-forward
	through these cutscenes, which skips most frame delays and reduces the rest?
	Due to the blocking nature of all commands, the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key state is
	only updated between commands or 2-byte text groups though, so it can't
	interrupt an ongoing delay.</li>
</ul><hr id="games-{{.Date}}"><p>
	Superficially, the list of game-specific differences doesn't look too long,
	and can be summarized in a rather short table:

</figcaption></figure><p>
	It's when you get into the implementation that the combined three systems
	reveal themselves as a giant mess, with more like 56 differences between the
	games. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Every single new weird line of code opened up
	another can of worms, which ultimately made all of this end up with 24
	pieces of bloat and 14 bugs. The worst of these should be quite interesting
	for the general PC-98 homebrew developers among my audience:
</p><ul>
	<li>The final official 0.23 release of master.lib has a bug in
	<code>graph_gaiji_put*()</code>. To calculate the JIS X 0208 code point for
	a gaiji, it is enough to <code>ADD 5680h</code> onto the gaiji ID. However,
	these functions accidentally use <code>ADC</code> instead, which incorrectly
	adds the x86 carry flag on top, causing weird off-by-one errors based on the
	previous program state. ZUN did fix this bug directly inside master.lib for
	TH04 and TH05, but still needed to work around it in TH03 by subtracting 1
	from the intended gaiji ID. Anyone up for maintaining a bug-fixed master.lib
	repository?</li>
	<li><p>The worst piece of bloat comes from TH03 and TH04 needlessly
	switching the visibility of VRAM pages while blitting a new 320×200 picture.
	This makes it much harder to understand the code, as the mere existence of
	these page switches is enough to suggest a more complex interplay between
	the two VRAM pages which doesn't actually exist. Outside this visibility
	switch, page 0 is always supposed to be shown, and page 1 is always used
	for temporarily storing pixels that are later crossfaded onto page 0. This
	is also the only reason why TH03 has to render text and gaiji onto both VRAM
	pages to begin with… and because TH04 doesn't, changing the picture in the
	middle of a string of text is technically bugged in that game, even though
	you only get to temporarily see the new text on very underclocked PC-98
	systems.</p><p>
	These performance implications made me wonder why cutscenes even bother with
	writing to the second VRAM page anyway, before copying each crossfade step
	to the visible one.
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-17" "We learned in June how costly EGC-\"accelerated\" inter-page copies are"}};
	shouldn't it be faster to just blit the image once rather than twice?<br>
	Well, master.lib decodes .PI images into a packed-pixel format, and
	unpacking such a representation into bitplanes on the fly is just about the
	worst way of blitting you could possibly imagine on a PC-98. EGC inter-page
	copies are already fairly disappointing at 42 cycles for every 16 pixels, if
	we look at the i486 and ignore VRAM latencies. But under the same
	conditions, packed-pixel unpacking comes in at 81 cycles for every <i>8</i>
	pixels, or almost 4× slower. On lower-end systems, that can easily sum up to
	more than one frame for a 320×200 image. While I'd argue that the resulting
	tearing could have been an acceptable part of the transition between two
	images, it's understandable why you'd want to avoid it in favor of the
	pure effect on a slower framerate.<br>
	Really makes me wonder why master.lib didn't just directly decode .PI images
	into bitplanes. The performance impact on load times should have been
	negligible? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} <a
	href="https://mooncore.eu/bunny/txt/pi-pic.htm">It's such a good format for
	the often dithered 16-color artwork you typically see on PC-98</a>, and
	deserves better than master.lib's implementation which is both slow to
	decode and slow to blit.
</p></li></ul><hr id="ref-{{.Date}}"><p>
	That brings us to the individual script commands… and yes, I'm going to
	document every single one of them. Some of their interactions and edge cases
	are not clear at all from just looking at the code.
</p><p>
	Almost all commands are preceded by… well, a <code>0x5C</code> lead byte.
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} Which raises the question of whether we should
	document it as an ASCII-encoded \&nbsp;backslash, or a Shift-JIS-encoded
	¥&nbsp;yen sign. From a gaijin perspective, it seems obvious that it's a
	backslash, as it's consistently displayed as one in most of the editors you
	would actually use nowadays. But interestingly, <code>iconv
	-f&nbsp;shift-jis -t&nbsp;utf-8</code> does convert any <code>0x5C</code>
	lead bytes to actual <code>¥ U+00A5 YEN SIGN</code> code points
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}.<br>
	Ultimately, the distinction comes down to the font. There <i>are</i> fonts
	that still render <code>0x5C</code> as <code>¥</code>, but mainly do so out
	of an obvious concern about backward compatibility to JIS X 0201, where this
	mapping originated. Unsurprisingly, this group includes MS Gothic/Mincho,
	the old Japanese fonts from Windows 3.1, but even Meiryo and Yu
	Gothic/Mincho, Microsoft's modern Japanese fonts. Meanwhile, pretty much
	every other modern font, and freely licensed ones in particular, render this
	code point as <code>\</code>, even if you set your editor to Shift-JIS. And
	while ZUN most definitely saw it as a <code>¥</code>, documenting this code
	point as <code>\</code> is less ambiguous in the long run. It can only
	possibly correspond to one specific code point in either Shift-JIS or UTF-8,
	and will remain correct even if we later mod the cutscene system to support
	full-blown Unicode.
</p><p>
	Now we've only got to clarify the parameter syntax, and then we can look at
	the big table of commands:
</p><ul>
	<li>Numeric parameters are read as sequences of up to 3 ASCII digits. This
	limits them to a range from 0 to 999 inclusive, with <code>000</code> and
	<code>0</code> being equivalent. Because there's no further sentinel
	character, any further digit from the 4<sup>th</sup> one onwards is
	interpreted as regular text.</li>
	<li>Filename parameters must be terminated with a space or newline and are
	limited to 12 characters, which translates to 8.3 basenames without any
	directory component. Any further characters are ignored and displayed as
	text as well.</li>
	<li>Each .PI image can contain up to four 320×200 pictures ("quarters") for
	the cutscene picture area. In the script commands, they are numbered like
	this: <table class="_{{.Date}}">
		<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>

		Font weight 3 is technically not rendered correctly in TH03 either; if

		at the left side of each glyph, which would extend into the previous
		VRAM byte. Ironically, the TH04/TH05 version is more <i>correct</i> in
		this regard: For half-width glyphs, it preserves any further pixel
		columns generated by the weight functions in the high byte of the 16-dot
		glyph variable. Unlike TH03, which still cuts them off when rendering
		text to unaligned X positions (3️⃣), TH04 and TH05 do bit-rotate them
		towards their correct place (4️⃣). It's only at byte-aligned X positions
		(2️⃣) where they remain at their internally calculated place, and appear
		on screen as these glitched pixel columns, 15 pixels away from the glyph
		they belong to. It's easy to blame bugs like these on micro-optimized
		ASM code, but in this instance, you really can't argue against it if the
		original C++ version was equally incorrect.

	So yeah, that's the cutscene system. I'm dreading the moment I will have to
	deal with the <i>other</i> command interpreter in these games, i.e., the
	stage enemy system. Luckily, that one is completely disconnected from any
	other system, so I won't have to deal with it until we're close to finishing
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code>… that is, unless someone requests it before. And it
	won't involve text encodings or unblitting…
</p><hr id="translations-{{.Date}}"><p>
	The cutscene system got me thinking in greater detail about how I would
	implement translations, being one of the main dependencies behind them. This
	goal has been on the order form for a while and could soon be implemented
	for these cutscenes, with 100% PI being right around the corner for the TH03
	and TH04 cutscene executables.<br>
	Once we're there, the "Virgin" old-school way of static translation patching
	for Latin-script languages could be implemented fairly quickly:
</p><ol>
	<li>Establish basic UTF-8 parsing for less painful manual editing of the
	source files</li>
	<li>Procedurally generate glyphs for the few required additional letters
	based on existing font ROM glyphs. For example, we'd generate <code>ä</code>
	by painting two short lines on top of the font ROM's <code>a</code> glyph,
	or generate <code>¿</code> by vertically flipping the question mark. This
	way, the text retains a consistent look regardless of whether the translated
	game is run with an NEC or EPSON font ROM, or the <img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhlgALAPABAAAAAAAAACH5BAUKAAEALAAAAACWAAsAAALiRI4IlskNo5xUvRqu0xjy1TWcKI3epJnRpWYb9bSf+Tnkkq74xu7KbwHBcAyD70AMCoG/Yyb5hCI9RyPIx6I+LdOtdxljloDCcrHoWrpe3rV7nWWbkVU280y2vfEdMD0P2PUnxuemxkUo2LYX1xX3qBeFARkIF7lIKXg4qIiG2NloOZj5triiR+oJeqlqWBLaqtbD+ucXuLlJu9epOZu4q2gH7Buc8zVDxmf7OopoG0byO8cZzRkbY9wEdigliW16giWpdHfibFPVXSpV9mX+QvxZ6YRi5KhVXn0PL1LTH22gAAA7"
	alt="hideous abomination"> that Neko Project II auto-generates if you
	don't provide either.</li>
	<li><i>(Optional)</i> Change automatic line breaks to work on a per-word
	basis, rather than per-glyph</li>
</ol><p>
	That's it – script editing and distribution would be handled by your local
	translation group. It might seem as if this would also work for Greek and
	Cyrillic scripts due to their presence in the PC-98 font ROM, but I'm not
	sure if I want to attempt procedurally shrinking these glyphs from 16×16 to
	8×16… For any more thorough solution, we'd need to go for a more "Chad" kind
	of full-blown translation support:
</p><ol>
	<li>Implement text subdivisions at a sensible granularity while retaining
	automatic line and box breaks</li>
	<li>Compile translatable text into a Japanese→target language dictionary
	(I'm too old to develop any further translation systems that would overwrite
	modded source text with translations of the original text)</li>
	<li>Implement a custom Unicode font system (glyphs would be taken from GNU
	Unifont unless translators provide a different 8×16 font for their
	language)</li>
	<li>Combine the text compiler with the font compiler to only store needed
	glyphs as part of the translation's font file (dealing with a multi-MB font
	file would be rather ugly in a Real Mode game)</li>
	<li>Write a simple install/update/patch stacking tool that supports both
	.HDI and raw-file DOSBox-X scenarios (it's different enough from thcrap to
	warrant a separate tool – each patch stack would be statically compiled into
	a single package file in the game's directory)</li>
	<li>Add a nice language selection option to the main menu</li>
	<li><i>(Optional)</i> Support proportional fonts</li>
</ol><p>
	Which sounds more like a separate project to be commissioned from
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}}'s Open Collective funds, separate from the ReC98 cap.
	This way, we can make sure that the feature is completely implemented, and I
	can talk with every interested translator to make sure that their language
	works.<br>
	It's still cheaper overall to do this on PC-98 than to first port the games
	to a modern system and <i>then</i> translate them. On the other hand, most
	of the tasks in the Chad variant (3, 4, 5, and half of 2) purely deal with
	the difficulty of getting arbitrary Unicode characters to work natively in a
	PC-98 DOS game at all, and would be either unnecessary or trivial if we had
	already ported the game. Depending on where the patrons' interests lie, it
	<i>may</i> not be worth it. So let's see what all of you think about  which
	way we should go<s>, or whether it's worth doing at all</s>. (<strong>Edit
	(2022-12-01):</strong> With {{DB_CustomerByID 6}}'s {{HTML_Currency 6000}}
	order towards the stage dialogue system, we've pretty much confirmed that it
	is.) Maybe we want to meet in the middle – using e.g. procedural glyph
	generation for dynamic translations to keep text rendering consistent with
	the rest of the PC-98 system, and just not support non-Latin-script
	languages in the beginning? In any case, I've added both options to the
	order form.<br>
	<strong>Edit (2023-07-28):</strong> {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} has agreed to fund
	a basic feature set somewhere between the Virgin and Chad level. Check the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-07-28" "dedicated announcement blog post"}} for more
	details and ideas, and to find out how you can support this goal!

	Surprisingly, there was still a bit of RE work left in the third push after
	all of this, which I filled with some small rendering boilerplate. Since I
	also wanted to include TH02's playfield overlay functions,
	<sup>1</sup>/<sub>15</sub> of that last push went towards getting a
	TH02-exclusive function out of the way, which also ended up including that
	game in this delivery. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br>
	The other small function pointed out how TH05's Stage 5 midboss pops into
	the playfield quite suddenly, since its clipping test thinks it's only 32
	pixels tall rather than 64:
</p><figure {{$popin.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $popin}}
	<figcaption>
		<s>Good chance that the pop-in might have been intended.</s><br>
		<strong>Edit (2023-06-30):</strong> Actually, it's a
		{{Blog_PostLink "2023-06-30" "systematic consequence of ZUN having to work around the lack of clipping in master.lib's sprite functions"}}.
		<br>
		There's even another quirk here: The white flash during its first frame
		is actually carried over from the <i>previous</i> midboss, which the
		game still considers as actively getting hit by the player shot that
		defeated it. It's the regular boilerplate code for <i>rendering</i> a
		midboss that resets the responsible damage variable, and that code
		doesn't run during the defeat explosion animation.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Next up: Staying with TH05 and looking at more of the pattern code of its
	boss fights. Given the remaining TH05 budget, it makes the most sense to
	continue in in-game order, with Sara and the Stage 2 midboss. If more money
	comes in towards this goal, I could alternatively go for the Mai & Yuki
	fight and immediately develop a pretty fix for the <a

	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/pull/9">a rather intricate
