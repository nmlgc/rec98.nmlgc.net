<p>
	Nothing really noteworthy in TH01's stage timer code, just yet another HUD
	element that is needlessly drawn into VRAM. Sure, ZUN applies his custom
	boldfacing effect on top of the glyphs retrieved from font ROM, but he could
	have easily installed those modified glyphs as gaiji.<br />
	Well, OK, halfwidth gaiji aren't exactly well documented, and sometimes not
	even correctly emulated
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-09-12" "due to the same PC-98 hardware oddity I was researching last month"}}.
	I've reserved two of the pending anonymous "anything" pushes for the
	conclusion of this research, just in case you were wondering why the
	outstanding workload is now lower after the two delivered here.
</p><p>
	And since it doesn't seem to be clearly documented elsewhere: Every 2 ticks
	on the stage timer correspond to 4 frames.
</p><hr /><p>
	So, TH01 <s>rank</s> pellet speed. The resident pellet speed value is a
	factor ranging from a minimum of -0.375 up to a maximum of 0.5 (pixels per
	frame), multiplied with the difficulty-adjusted base speed for each pellet
	and added on top of that same speed. This multiplier is modified
</p><ul>
	<li>every time the stage timer reaches 0 and
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> is shown (+0.05)</li>
	<li>for every score-based extra life granted below the maximum number of
	lives (+0.025)</li>
	<li>every time a bomb is used (+0.025)</li>
	<li>on every frame in which the <code>rand</code> value (shown in debug
	mode) is evenly divisible by
	<code>(1800¬†-¬†(lives¬†√ó¬†200)¬†-¬†(bombs¬†√ó¬†50))</code> (+0.025)</li>
	<li>every time Reimu got hit (set to 0 if higher, then -0.05)</li>
	<li>when using a continue (set to -0.05 if higher, then -0.125)</li>
</ul><p>
	Apparently, ZUN noted that these deltas couldn't be losslessly stored in an
	IEEE 754 floating-point variable, and therefore didn't store the pellet
	speed factor exactly in a way that would correspond to its gameplay effect.
	Instead, it's stored similar to Q12.4 subpixels: as a simple integer,
	pre-multiplied by 40. This results in a raw range of -15 to 20, which is
	what the undecompiled ASM calls still use. When spawning a new pellet, its
	base speed is first multiplied by that factor, and then divided by 40 again.
	This is actually quite smart: The calculation doesn't need to be aware of
	either Q12.4 <i>or</i> the 40√ó format, as
	<code>((Q12Ôªø.Ôªø4¬†*¬†factor√ó40)¬†/¬†factor√ó40)</code> still comes out as a
	Q12.4 subpixel even if all numbers are integers. The only limiting issue
	here would be the potential overflow of the 16-bit multiplication at
	unadjusted base speeds of more than 50 pixels per frame, but that'd be
	<i>seriously</i> unplayable.<br />
	So yeah, pellet speed modifications are indeed gradual, and don't just fall
	into the coarse three "high, normal, and low" categories.
</p><hr /><p>
	That's ‚Öù of P0160 done, and the continue and pause menus would make good
	candidates to fill up the remaining ‚Öú‚Ä¶ except that it seemed impossible to
	figure out the correct compiler options for this code?<br />
	The issues centered around the two effects of Turbo C++ 4.0J's
	<code>-O</code> switch:
</p><ol>
	<li>Optimizing jump instructions: merging duplicate successive jumps into a
	single one, and merging duplicated instructions at the end of conditional
	branches into a single place under a single branch, which the other branches
	then jump to</li>
	<li>Compressing <code>ADD SP</code> and <code>POP CX</code>
	stack-clearing instructions after multiple successive <code>CALL</code>s to
	<code>__cdecl</code> functions into a single <code>ADD SP</code> with the
	combined parameter stack size of all function calls</li>
</ol><p>
	But how can the ASM for these functions exhibit #1 but <i>not</i> #2? How
	can it be seemingly optimized <i>and</i> unoptimized at the same time? The
	only option that gets somewhat close would be <code>-O-¬†-y</code>, which
	emits line number information into the .OBJ files for debugging. This
	combination provides its own kind of #1, but these functions clearly need
	the real deal.
</p><p>
	The research into this issue ended up consuming a full push on its own.
	In the end, this solution turned out to be completely unrelated to compiler
	options, and instead came from the effects of a compiler bug in a totally
	different place. Initializing a local structure instance or array like
</p><pre>const uint4_t flash_colors[3] = { 3, 4, 5 };</pre><p>
	always emits the <code>{¬†3,¬†4,¬†5¬†}</code> array into the program's data
	segment, and then generates a call to the internal <code>SCOPY@</code>
	function which copies this data array to the local variable on the stack.
	And as soon as this <code>SCOPY@</code> call is emitted, the <code>-O</code>
	optimization #1 is disabled <i>for the entire rest of the translation
	unit</i>?!<br />
	So, any code segment with an <code>SCOPY@</code> call followed by
	<code>__cdecl</code> functions must strictly be decompiled from top to
	bottom, mirroring the original layout of translation units. That means no
	TH01 continue and pause menus before we haven't decompiled the bomb
	animation, which contains such an <code>SCOPY@</code> call. üòï<br />
	Luckily, TH01 is the only game where this bug leads to significant
	restrictions in decompilation order, as later games predominantly use the
	<code>pascal</code> calling convention, in which each function itself clears
	its stack as part of its <code>RET</code> instruction.
</p><hr /><p>
	What now, then? With 51% of <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> decompiled, we're
	slowly running out of small features that can be decompiled within ‚Öú of a
	push. Good that I haven't been looking a lot into <code>OP.EXE</code> and
	<code>FUUIN.EXE</code>, which pretty much <i>only</i> got easy pieces of
	code left to do. Maybe I'll end up finishing their decompilations entirely
	within these smaller gaps?<br /> I still ended up finding one more small
	piece in <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> though: The particle system, seen in the
	Mima fight.
</p><figure>{{call .VideoPlayer $vid}}</figure><p>
	I like how everything about this animation is contained within a single
	function that is called once per frame, but ZUN could have really
	consolidated the spawning code for new particles a bit. In Mima's fight,
	particles are only spawned from the top and right edges of the screen, but
	the function in fact contains unused code for all other 7 possible
	directions, written in quite a bloated manner. This wouldn't feel quite as
	{{HTML_TagInline "unused"}} if ZUN had used an angle parameter instead‚Ä¶
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} Also, why unnecessarily waste another 40 bytes of
	the BSS segment?
</p><p>
	But wait, what's going on with the very first spawned particle that just
	stops near the bottom edge of the screen in the video above? Well, even in
	such a simple and self-contained function, ZUN managed to include an
	off-by-one error. This one then results in an out-of-bounds array access on
	the 80th frame, where the code attempts to spawn a 41<sup>st</sup>
	particle. If the first particle was unlucky to be both slow enough and
	spawned away far enough from the bottom and right edges, the spawning code
	will then kill it off before its unblitting code gets to run, leaving its
	pixel on the screen until something else overlaps it and causes it to be
	unblitted.<br />
	Which, during regular gameplay, will quickly happen with the Orb, all the
	pellets flying around, and your own player movement. Also, the RNG can
	easily spawn this particle at a position and velocity that causes it to
	leave the screen more quickly. Kind of impressive how ZUN laid out the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arrays">structure
	of arrays</a> in a way that ensured practically no effect of this bug on the
	game; this glitch could have easily happened <i>every</i> 80 frames instead.
	He <i>almost</i> got close to all bugs canceling out each other here!
