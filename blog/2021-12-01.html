	Made it through almost three years without a price increase! It's been
	overdue for a while, though.
</p><p>
	With the last months being full of rather research- and documentation-heavy
	pushes, I've been just about able to keep up with the existing
	subscriptions. By now, the amount of quality control and documentation I
	found myself putting into this project has far surpassed the raw
	reverse-engineering work. Back at the beginning of 2019 when I decided on
	the previous push price of 30 €, I didn't have this blog nor the current
	aspirations at code quality. Neither of these have ever been reflected in
	the price, and I still find it hard to put a number on them. On the other
	hand, I continue to dislike the typical Patreon model of no inherent defined
	obligations on my part, and no direct association of the resulting work with
	the person who funded it. You might have noticed that I don't use the word
	"donations" anywhere, and instead refer to them as "orders" or "purchases" –
	and that's precisely for this reason.<br>
	The result, however, has been a sold-out store for pretty much all of 2021.
	I can only begin to imagine how much potential revenue I've already lost
	from people who might have wanted to contribute at one point, but couldn't,
	and have already written off this project…
</p><p>
	Raising prices is pretty much the only way to get the pending workload back
	to a more comfortable amount. I also thought about a two-tiered system: Have
	a documentation-less option for 30 €, and take 60 € for any push that should
	be accompanied by a blog post. However, skimping on documentation will
	compromise the quality of the code as well. Writing these blog posts
	presents another chance of improving it before release, which has made quite
	a difference on many occasions. And after all, this documentation is the one
	thing about ReC98 that people mainly interact with. As long as we haven't
	hit 100% RE, the actual code seems to be an afterthought, which is perfectly
	understandable: Why start work on a bigger mod or port now if the code is
	steadily improving in every aspect, and it all will be just a bit more
	maintainable in a few months?
</p><p>
	But why go more commercial then, and especially now? If the recent attention
	to <a href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a>'s PC-98 Touhou
	collection package is any indication, ReC98 has a way bigger career
	potential than the dead-end RL job I found myself in. Demand for <a
	href="https://twitter.com/HeroOnTheWind/status/1456608993783189507">fixed
	translations</a> and <a
	href="https://twitter.com/berunto88/status/1456359566543835136">replay
	support</a> is definitely there – and given that these haven't been done so
	far, it's very likely that I'll end up as the one to implement such mods,
	especially if that should happen before reaching 100% RE or PI. People also

	><i>still</i> seem to want*</span> a port to IBM-compatible DOS,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-04" "even though this makes no sense"}}? But if
	this is something you all want to pay for, then sure, why not.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br>
	And even right now, working on ReC98 sure beats writing junk software using
	ill-suited technologies for highly corporate clients, or living close to a
	world where academic papers are valued higher than working and maintained
	code. I am in fact very happy whenever I'm done with that for the day, and
	get to work on ReC98! Who would have thought.
</p><p>
	So let's try to grow this into an actual business and raise prices to match
	demand, going up to a nicely divisible 60 € per push. If you all still
	manage to regularly sell out the store at <i>this</i> level and I get to
	raise prices again, I should be able to reduce RL work further and therefore
	raise the cap as well. Now that I've also clarified a potential route
	towards self-employment, I'm going to react to these sell-out events more
	quickly, and with smaller raises. So, no further immediate doubling in the
	future.
</p><p>
	Now, will this delay the currently highly awaited 100% completion of TH01
	past August 2022, the 25th anniversary of its release? We'll see once we're
	back to an almost empty backlog, after I'm done with the TH01 Sariel fight.
	I'm hopeful that such a price increase will give a new voice to the goals
	and priorities of less wealthy potential patrons. This crowdfunding is very
	much designed to be hacked by "microtransactions" – small contributions with
	specific requests that require other, larger generic contributions to be
	fulfilled – and I'd like to see more of that. 😛 And even if 60 € per push
	is already more than the combined fandom wants to pay, that means I can get
	the {{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-03" "16-bit build system"}} done before the
	first big 100% release. (Trust me, you really want that!)
</p><p>
	I will still deliver the entire current backlog at the value the
	contributions were originally purchased at. Due to the way the cap has to be
	calculated, these contributions now appear to have doubled in value. All
	existing subscriptions will then pay for half of their original pushes
	starting with their respective December 2021 transaction.

	Next up: A bunch of smaller website features, including:
</p><ul>
	<li>a caching strategy for static content,</li>
	<li>a third set of percentage bars to visualize the remaining technical
	debt,</li>
	<li>and, hopefully, some new payment methods that expand the number of
	countries I can accept money from. (Yes, this was requested at one point
	earlier this year!)</li>
</ul>
