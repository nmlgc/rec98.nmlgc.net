	Oh look, it's another rather short and straightforward boss with a rather
	small number of bugs and quirks. Yup, contrary to the character's
	popularity, Mima's premiere is really not all that special in terms of code,
	and continues the trend established with
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-17" "Kikuri"}} and
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-25" "SinGyoku"}}. I've already covered
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-08" "the initial sprite-related bugs last November"}},
	so this post focuses on the main code of the fight itself. The overview:
</p><ul>
	<li>The TH01 Mima fight consists of 3 phases, with phases 1 and 3 each
	corresponding to one half of the 12-HP bar.
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-25" "Just like with SinGyoku"}}, the distinction
	between the red-white and red parts is purely visual once again, and doesn't
	reflect anything about the boss script. As usual, all of the phases have to
	be completed in order.</li>
	<li>Phases 1 and 3 cycle through 4 danmaku patterns each, for a total of 8.
	The cycles always start on a fixed pattern.</li>
	<li>3 of the patterns in each phase feature rotating white squares, thus
	introducing a new sprite in need of being unblitted.</li>
	<li>Phase 1 additionally features the "hop pattern" as the last one in its
	cycle. This is the only pattern where Mima leaves the seal in the center of
	the playfield to hop from one edge of the playfield towards the other, while
	also moving slightly higher up on the Y axis, and staying on the final
	position for the next pattern cycle. For the first time, Mima selects a
	random starting edge, which is then alternated on successive cycles.</li>
	<li>Since the square entities are local to the respective pattern function,
	Phase 1 can only end once the current pattern is done, even if Mima's HP are
	already below 6. This makes Mima susceptible to the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "test/debug mode HP bar heap corruption bug"}}.</li>
	<li>Phase 2 simply consists of a spread-in teleport back to Mima's initial
	position in the center of the playfield. This would only have been strictly
	necessary if phase 1 ended on the hop pattern, but is done regardless of the
	previous pattern, and does provide a nice visual separation between the two
	main phases.</li>
	<li>That's it â€“ nothing special in Phase 3.</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	And there aren't even any weird hitboxes this time. What <i>is</i> maybe
	special about Mima, however, is how there's something to cover about all of
	her patterns. Since this is TH01, it's won't surprise anyone that the
	rotating square patterns are one giant copy-pasta of unblitting, updating,
	and rendering code. At least ZUN placed the core polarâ†’Cartesian
	transformation in a separate function for creating <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon">regular polygons</a>
	with an arbitrary number of sides, which might hint toward some more varied
	shapes having been planned at one point?<br />
	5 of the 6 patterns even follow the exact same steps during square update
	frames:
</p><ol>
	<li>Calculate square corner coordinates</li>
	<li>Unblit the square</li>
	<li>Update the square angle and radius</li>
	<li>Use the square corner coordinates for spawning pellets or missiles</li>
	<li>Recalculate square corner coordinates</li>
	<li>Render the square</li>
</ol><p>
	Notice something? Bullets are spawned <i>before</i> the corner coordinates
	are updated. That's why their initial positions seem to be a bit off â€“ they
	<i>are</i> spawned exactly in the corners of the square, it's just that it's
	the square from 8 frames ago. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}

</figure><p>
	Once ZUN reached the final laser pattern though, he must have noticed that
	there's something wrong thereâ€¦ or maybe he just <i>wanted</i> to fire those
	lasers independently from the square unblit/update/render timer for a
	change. Spending an additional 16 bytes of the data segment for conveniently
	remembering the square corner coordinates across frames was definitely a
	decent investment.

</figure><hr /><p>
	When Mima isn't shooting bullets from the corners of a square or hopping
	across the playfield, she's raising flame pillars <img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhIAAQAIABAP8AAMCAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAAgABAAAAJEjI8ItgmvYmINsvDanDrn020gBVnlJyqLh3krqm2nS3+WWOd12up+jAH9fo7K0Md5HXWj3pLZEj5zUdWUmry6cFrWoQAAOw=="
	/> from the bottom of the playfield within very specifically calculated
	random rangesâ€¦ which are then rendered at byte-aligned VRAM positions, while
	collision detection still uses their actual pixel position. Since I  don't
	want to sound like a broken record all too much, I'll just direct you to
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-17" "Kikuri, where we've seen the exact same issue with the teardrop ripple sprites"}}.
	The conclusions are identical as well.

		casting sprite</a> doesn't unblit the meteor, and leaves that job to
		any sprite that happens to fly over those pixels.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	However, I'd say that the saddest part about this pattern is how choppy it
	is, with the circle/pillar entities updating and rendering at a meager 7
	FPS. Why go that low on purpose when you can just make the game render âœ¨
	<i>smoothly</i> âœ¨ instead?
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_p4_s}}
	<figcaption>So smooth it's almost uncanny.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	The reason quickly becomes obvious: With TH01's lack of optimization, going
	for the full 56.4 FPS would have significantly slowed down the game on its
	intended 33 MHz CPUs, requiring more than cheap surface-level ASM
	optimization for a stable frame rate. That might very well have been ZUN's
	reason for only ever rendering one circle per frame to VRAM, and designing
	the pattern with these time offsets in mind. It's always been typical for
	PC-98 developers to target the lowest-spec models that could possibly still
	run a game, and implementing dynamic frame rates into such an engine-less
	game is nothing I would wish on anybody. And it's not like TH01 is
	particularly unique in its choppiness anyway; low frame rates are actually a
	rather typical part of the PC-98 game aesthetic.
</p><hr /><p>
	The final piece of weirdness in this fight can be found in phase 1's hop
	pattern, and specifically its palette manipulation. Just from looking at the
	pattern code itself, each of the 4 hops is supposed to darken the hardware
	palette by subtracting <code>#444</code> from every color. At the last hop,
	every color should have therefore been reduced to a pitch-black
	<code>#000</code>, leaving the player completely blind to the movement of
	the chasing pellets for 30 frames and making the pattern quite ghostly
	indeed. However, that's not what we see in the actual game:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<figcaption class="dynamic"><div>
		Nothing in the pattern's code would cause the hardware palette to get
		brighter before the end of the pattern, and yetâ€¦
	</div><div>
		The expected version doesn't look all too unfair, even on Lunaticâ€¦
		well, at least at the default <s>rank</s> pellet speed shown in this
		video. At maximum pellet speed, it <i>is</i> in fact rather brutal.
	</div></figcaption>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_hop_0.SetActive $vid_hop_1}}
</figure><p>
	Looking at the frame counter, it appears that <i>something</i> outside the
	pattern resets the palette every 40 frames. The only known constant with a
	value of 40 would be the invincibility frames after hitting a boss with the
	Orb, but we're not hitting Mima hereâ€¦ {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}<br />
	But as it turns out, that's exactly where the palette reset comes from: The
	hop animation darkens the hardware palette directly, while the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-12-18" "infamous 12-parameter boss collision handler function"}}
	unconditionally resets the hardware palette to the "default boss palette"
	every 40 frames, regardless of whether the boss was hit or not. I'd classify
	this as a bug: That function has no business doing periodic hardware palette
	resets outside the invincibility flash effect, and it completely defies
	common sense that it does.
</p><p>
	That explains one unexpected palette change, but could this function
	possibly also explain the other infamous one, namely, the temporary green
	discoloration in the Konngara fight? That glitch comes down to how the game
	actually uses <i>two</i> global "default" palettes: a default <i>boss</i>
	palette for undoing the invincibility flash effect, and a default
	<i>stage</i> palette for returning the colors back to normal at the end of
	the bomb animation or when leaving the Pause menu. And sure enough, the
	<i>stage</i> palette is the one with the green color, while the <i>boss</i>
	palette contains the intended colors used throughout the fight. Sending the
	latter palette to the graphics chip every 40 frames is what <i>corrects</i>
	the discoloration, which would otherwise be permanent.
</p><p>
	The green color comes from <code>BOSS7_D1.GRP</code>, the scrolling
	background of the entrance animation. That's what turns this into a clear
	bug: The <i>stage</i> palette is only set a single time in the entire fight,
	at the beginning of the entrance animation, to the palette of this image.
	Apart from consistency reasons, it doesn't even make sense to set the stage
	palette there, as you can't enter the Pause menu or bomb during a blocking
	animation function.<br />
	And just 3 lines of code later, ZUN loads <code>BOSS8_A1.GRP</code>, the
	main background image of the fight. Moving the stage palette assignment
	there would have easily prevented the discoloration.
</p><p>
	But yeah, as you can tell, palette manipulation is complete jank in this
	game. Why differentiate between a stage and a boss palette to begin with?
	The blocking Pause menu function could have easily copied the original
	palette to a local variable before darkening it, and then restored it after
	closing the menu. It's not so easy for bombs as the intended palette could
	change between the start and end of the animation, but the code could have
	still been simplified a lot if there was just one global "default palette"
	variable instead of two. Heck, even the other bosses who manipulate their
	palettes correctly only do so because they manually synchronize the two
	after every change. The proper defense against bugs that result from wild
	mutation of global state is to get rid of global state, and not to put up
	safety nets hidden in the middle of existing effect code.

	In any case, that's Mima done! 7<sup>th</sup> PC-98 Touhou boss fully
	decompiled, 24 bosses remaining, and 59 functions left in all of TH01.
</p><hr /><p>
	In other thrilling news, my call for secondary funding priorities in new
	TH01 contributions has given us three different priorities so far. This
	raises an interesting question though: Which of these contributions should I
	now put towards TH01 immediately, and which ones should I leave in the
	backlog for the time being? Since I've never liked deciding on priorities,
	let's turn this into a popularity contest instead: The contributions with
	the least popular secondary priorities will go towards TH01 first, giving
	the most popular priorities a higher chance to still be left over after TH01
	is done. As of this delivery, we'd have the following popularity order:
</p><ol>
	<li>TH05 (1.67 pushes), from T0182</li>
	<li>Seihou (1 push), from T0184</li>
	<li>TH03 (0.67 pushes), from T0146</li>
</ol><p>
	Which means that T0146 will be consumed for TH01 next, followed by T0184 and
	then T0182. I only assign transactions immediately before a delivery though,
	so you all still have the chance to change up these priorities before the
	next one.
</p><p>
	Next up: The final boss of TH01 decompilation, YuugenMaganâ€¦ <s>if the current
	or newly incoming TH01 funds happen to be enough to cover the entire fight.
	If they don't turn out to be, I will have to pass the time with some Seihou
	work instead, missing the TH01 anniversary deadline as a result.</s>
	<strong>Edit (2022-07-18):</strong> Thanks to {{DB_CustomerByID 10}} for
	securing the funding for YuugenMagan after all! That fight will feature
	slightly more than half of all remaining code in TH01's
	<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> and the single biggest function in all of PC-98
	Touhou, let's go!
