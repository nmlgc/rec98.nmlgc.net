	Here we go, TH01 Sariel! This is the single biggest boss fight in all of
	PC-98 Touhou: If we include all custom effect code we previously decompiled,
	it amounts to a total of <span class="hovertext" title="And that's just raw instruction numbers. Those might be not that representative as they include code shared between the executables, with single C++ translation units being counted two or three times.">10.31% of all code in TH01 (and 3.14%
	overall)</span>. These 8 pushes cover the final 8.10% (or 2.47% overall),
	and are likely to be the single biggest delivery this project will ever see.
	Considering that I only managed to decompile 6.00% across all games in 2021,
	2022 is already off to a much better start!
</p><p>
	So, how can Sariel's code be that large? Well, we've got:
</p><ul>
	<li>16 danmaku patterns; including the one snowflake detonating into a giant
	94×32 hitbox</li>
	<li>Gratuitous usage of floating-point variables, bloating the binary thanks
	to Turbo C++ 4.0J's particularly horrid code generation</li>
	<li>The hatching birds that shoot pellets</li>
	<li>3 separate particle systems, sharing the general idea, overall code
	structure, and blitting algorithm, but differing in every little detail</li>
	<li>The "gust of wind" background transition animation</li>
	<li>5 sets of custom monochrome sprite animations, loaded from
	<code>BOSS6GR?.GRC</code></li>
	<li>A further 3 hardcoded monochrome 8×8 sprites for the "swaying leaves"
	pattern during the second form</li>
</ul><p>
	In total, it's just under 3,000 lines of C++ code, containing a total of 8
	definite ZUN bugs, 3 of them being subpixel/pixel confusions. That might not
	look all <i>too</i> bad if you compare it to the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-10-20" "player control function's 8 bugs in 900 lines of code"}},
	but given that Konngara had <s>0</s>… (<strong>Edit (2022-07-17):</strong>
	Konngara contains two bugs after all: A
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "possible heap corruption in test or debug mode"}},
	and the infamous
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-17" "temporary green discoloration"}}.)
	And no, the code doesn't make it obvious whether ZUN coded Konngara or
	Sariel first; there's just as much evidence for either.
</p><p>
	Some terminology before we start: Sariel's first <i>form</i> is separated
	into four <i>phases</i>, indicated by different background images, that
	cycle until Sariel's HP reach 0 and the second, single-phase <i>form</i>
	starts. The danmaku <i>patterns</i> within each phase are also on a cycle,
	and the game picks a random but limited number of patterns per phase before
	transitioning to the next one. The fight always starts at pattern 1 of phase
	1 (the random purple lasers), and each new phase also starts at its
	respective first pattern.
</p><hr /><p>
	Sariel's bugs already start at the graphics asset level, before any code
	gets to run. Some of the patterns include a wand raise animation, which is
	stored in <code>BOSS6_2.BOS</code>:
</p><figure class="pixelated">
	<a href="{{$pic1}}"><img
		src="{{$pic1}}" alt="TH01 BOSS6_2.BOS" style="height: 192px"/></a>
	<figcaption>Umm… OK? The same sprite twice, just with slightly different
	colors? So how is the wand lowered again?</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	The "lowered wand" sprite is missing in this file simply because it's
	captured from the regular background image in VRAM, at the beginning of the
	fight and after every background transition. What I previously thought to be
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-08" "background storage code"}} has therefore a
	different meaning in Sariel's case. Since this captured sprite is fully
	opaque, it will reset the entire 128×128 wand area… wait, 128×128, rather
	than 96×96? Yup, this lowered sprite is larger than necessary, wasting 1,967
	bytes of conventional memory.<br /> That still doesn't quite explain the
	second sprite in <code>BOSS6_2.BOS</code> though. Turns out that the black
	part is indeed <i>meant to unblit the purple reflection (?) in the first
	sprite</i>. But… that's not how you would correctly unblit that?
</p><figure class="side_by_side pixelated">
	<a href="{{$pic2}}"><img
		src="{{$pic2}}"
		alt="VRAM after blitting the first sprite of TH01's BOSS6_2.BOS"
		style="height: 224px;"/></a>
	<a href="{{$pic3}}"><img
		src="{{$pic3}}"
		alt="VRAM after blitting the second sprite of TH01's BOSS6_2.BOS"
		style="height: 224px;"/></a>
</figure></p>
	The first sprite already eats up part of the red HUD line, and the second
	one additionally fails to recover the seal pixels underneath, leaving a nice
	little black hole and some stray purple pixels until the next background
	transition. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} Quite ironic given that both
	sprites do include the right part of the seal, which isn't even part of the
	animation.
</p><hr /><p>
	Just like Konngara, Sariel continues the approach of using a single function
	per danmaku pattern or custom entity. While I appreciate that this allows
	all pattern- and entity-specific state to be scoped locally to that one
	function, it quickly gets ugly as soon as such a function has to do more than one thing.<br />
	The "bird function" is particularly awful here: It's just one <code>if(…)
	{…} else&nbsp;if(…) {…} else&nbsp;if(…) {…}</code> chain with different
	branches for the subfunction parameter, with zero shared code between any of
	these branches. It also uses 64-bit floating-point <code>double</code> as
	its subpixel type… and since it also takes four of those as parameters
	(y'know, just in case the "spawn new bird" subfunction is called), every
	call site has to also push four <code>double</code> values onto the stack.
	Thanks to Turbo C++ even using the FPU for <i>pushing a 0.0 constant</i>, we
	have already reached maximum floating-point decadence before even having
	seen a single danmaku pattern. Why decadence? Every possible spawn position
	and velocity in both bird patterns just uses pixel resolution, with no
	fractional component in sight. And there goes another 720 bytes of
	conventional memory.
</p><p>
	Speaking about bird patterns, the red-bird one is where we find the first
	code-level ZUN bug: The spawn cross circle sprite suddenly disappears after
	it finished spawning all the bird eggs. How can we tell it's a bug? Because
	there <i>is</i> code to smoothly fly this sprite off the playfield, that
	code just suddenly forgets that the sprite's position is stored in Q12.4
	subpixels, and treats it as raw screen pixels instead.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} As a result, the well-intentioned 640×400
	screen-space clipping rectangle effectively shrinks to 38×23 pixels in the
	top-left corner of the screen. Which the sprite is always outside of, and
	thus never rendered again.<br />
	The intended animation is easily restored though:
</p><figure class="fullres">
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid1.SetActive $vid2}}
	<figcaption>
		Sariel's third pattern, and the first to spawn birds, in its original
		and fixed versions. Note that I somewhat fixed the bird hatch animation
		as well: ZUN's code never unblits any frame of animation there, and
		simply blits every new one on top of the previous one.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Also, did you know that birds actually have a quite unfair 14×38-pixel
	hitbox? Not that you'd ever collide with them in any of the patterns…
</p><p>
	Another 3 of the 8 bugs can be found in the symmetric, interlaced spawn rays
	used in three of the patterns, and the 32×32 debris "sprites" <img
		src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhYAAgAPABAAAAAP///yH5BAUKAAEALAAAAABgACAAAAJVjI+py+0Po5y0Wgqu3jHzD4biSJaNZ6bqyrauhL4yEs+2XN/6zvda7gtegEOhEXdMKpdMDvHzNESP06a1V736shOuyKsNf8XkCriM3p3TbNO6DW8XAAA7"
		style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="" /> shown at their endpoint, at
	the edge of the screen. You kinda have to commend ZUN's attention to detail
	here, and how he wrote a lot of code for those few rapidly animated pixels
	that you most likely <span class="hovertext" title="And your brain probably didn't either, with all the sloppy unblitting everywhere…">don't
	even notice</span>, especially with all the other <i>wrong</i> pixels
	resulting from rendering glitches. One of the bugs in the very final pattern
	of phase 4 even turns them into the vortex sprites from the second pattern
	in phase 1 <img
		src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhYAAgAPABAAAAAP///yH5BAUKAAEALAAAAABgACAAAAK0jI+py+0Pozyggomz3sj6y3VgSE5WqVToCqks5b4yNQeePOK1HbP5/roFgbuTjjgzDpGan8j5VDqkqQ9z2kt8hA1uNAZdLrKM7cO7DRexEevZaL52sOpoO11PrcghN53atpeX4dXCx1Zy2Kc4xtiY6Fh2RhgpQoJ2N4kBiMhBNch5WQkzWPZZFyraNGqnpVYouMrKw1kIizL75YN3qyp6UvqXJkdsGFeMnKy8zNzs/Awd7VwAADs="
		style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="" /> during the first 5 frames of
	the first time the pattern is active, and I had to single-step the blitting
	calls to verify it.<br />
	It certainly was annoying how much time I spent making sense of these bugs,
	and all weird blitting offsets, for just <i>a few pixels</i>… Let's look at
	something more wholesome, shall we?
</p><hr /><p>
	So far, we've only seen the PC-98 GRCG being used in RMW (read-modify-write)
	mode, which I previously
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-12-18" "explained in the context of TH01's red-white HP pattern"}}.
	The second of its three modes, TCR (Tile Compare Read), affects VRAM reads
	rather than writes, and performs "color extraction" across all 4 bitplanes:
	Instead of returning raw 1bpp data from one plane, a VRAM read will instead
	return a bitmask, with a 1 bit at every pixel whose full 4-bit color exactly
	matches the color at that offset in the GRCG's tile register, and 0
	everywhere else. Sariel uses this mode to make sure that the 2×2 particles
	and the wind effect are only blitted on top of "air color" pixels, with
	other parts of the background behaving like a mask. The algorithm:
</p><ol>
	<li>Set the GRCG to TCR mode, and all 8 tile register dots to the air
	color</li>
	<li>Read N bits from the target VRAM position to obtain an N-bit mask where
	all 1 bits indicate air color pixels at the respective position</li>
	<li>AND that mask with the alpha plane of the sprite to be drawn, shifted to
	the correct start bit within the 8-pixel VRAM byte</li>
	<li>Set the GRCG to RMW mode, and all 8 tile register dots to the color that
	should be drawn</li>
	<li>Write the previously obtained bitmask to the same position in VRAM</li>
</ol><p>
	Quite clever how the extracted colors double as a secondary alpha plane,
	making for another well-earned {{HTML_Tag "good-code" nil}} tag. The wind effect really doesn't deserve it, though:
</p><ul>
	<li>ZUN calculates <i>every</i> intermediate result inside this function
	<i>over</i> and <i>over</i> and <i>over</i> again… Together with some ugly
	pointer arithmetic, this function turned into one of the most tedious
	decompilations in a long while.</li>
	<li>This gradual effect is blitted exclusively to the front page of VRAM,
	since parts of it need to be unblitted to create the illusion of a gust of
	wind. Then again, anything that moves on top of air-colored background –
	most likely the Orb – will also unblit whatever it covered of the effect…
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}</li>
</ul><p>
	As far as I can tell, ZUN didn't use TCR mode anywhere else in PC-98 Touhou.
	Tune in again later during a TH04 or TH05 push to learn about TDW, the final
	GRCG mode!
</p><hr /><p>
	Speaking about the 2×2 particle systems, why do we need three of them? Their
	only observable difference lies in the way they move their particles:
</p><ol>
	<li>Up or down in a straight line (used in phases 4 and 2,
	respectively)</li>
	<li>Left or right in a straight line (used in the second form)</li>
	<li>Left and right in a sinusoidal motion (used in phase 3, the "dark
	orange" one)</li>
</ol><p>
	Out of all possible formats ZUN could have used for storing the positions
	and velocities of individual particles, he chose a) 64-bit /
	double-precision floating-point, and b) raw screen pixels. Want to take a
	guess at which data type is used for which particle system?
</p><p>
	If you picked <code>double</code> for 1) and 2), and raw screen pixels for
	3), you are of course correct! {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} Not that I'm implying
	that it should have been the other way round – screen pixels would have
	perfectly fit all three <s>systems</s> use cases, as all 16-bit coordinates
	are extended to 32 bits for trigonometric calculations anyway. That's what,
	another 1.080 bytes of wasted conventional memory? And that's even
	calculated <i>while</i> keeping the current architecture, which allocates
	space for 3×30 particles as part of the game's global data, although only
	one of the three particle systems is active at any given time.
</p><p>
	That's it for the first form, time to put on <span lang="ja">"Civilization
	of Magic"</span>! Or <span lang="ja">"死なばもろとも"</span>? Or <span
	lang="ja">"Theme of 地獄めくり"</span>? Or whatever <code>SYUGEN</code> is
	supposed to mean…
<p><hr /><p>
	… and the code of these final patterns comes out roughly as exciting as
	their in-game impact. With the big exception of the very final "swaying
	leaves" pattern: After {{Blog_PostLink "2019-12-05" "Q4.4"}},
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-12" "Q28.4"}},
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-10-06" "Q24.8"}}, and <code>double</code> variables,
	this pattern uses… <i>decimal</i> subpixels? Like, multiplying the number by
	10, and using the decimal one's digit to represent the fractional part?
	Well, sure, if you <i>really</i> insist on moving the leaves in cleanly
	represented integer multiples of ⅒, which is infamously impossible in IEEE
	754. Aside from aesthetic reasons, it only really combines less precision
	(10 possible fractions rather than the usual 16) with the inferior
	performance of having to use integer divisions and multiplications rather
	than simple bit shifts. And it's surely not because the leaf sprites needed
	an extended integer value range of [﻿-3276,&nbsp;+3276﻿], compared to
	Q12.4's [﻿-2047,&nbsp;+2048﻿]: They are clipped to 640×400 screen space
	anyway, and are removed as soon as they leave this area.
</p><p>
	This pattern also contains the second bug in the "subpixel/pixel confusion
	hiding an entire animation" category, causing all of
	<code>BOSS6GR4.GRC</code> to effectively become {{HTML_Tag "unused" nil}}:
</p><figure class="fullres">
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid3.SetActive $vid4}}
	<figcaption>
		The "swaying leaves" pattern. ZUN intended a splash animation to be
		shown once each leaf "spark" reaches the top of the playfield, which is
		never displayed in the original game.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	At least their hitboxes are what you would expect, exactly covering the
	30×30 pixels of Reimu's sprite. Both animation fixes are available on the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/th01_sariel_fixes"><code>th01_sariel_fixes</code></a>
	branch.
</p><p>
	After all that, Sariel's main function turned out fairly unspectacular, just
	putting everything together and adding some shake, transition, and color
	pulse effects with a bunch of unnecessary hardware palette changes. There is
	one reference to a missing <code>BOSS6.GRP</code> file during the
	first→second form transition, suggesting that Sariel originally had a
	separate "first form defeat" graphic, before it was replaced with just the
	shaking effect in the final game.<br />
	Speaking about the transition code, it is kind of funny how the… um,
	<i>imperative</i> and <i>concrete</i> nature of TH01 leads to these 2×24
	lines of straight-line code. They kind of look like ZUN rattling off a
	laundry list of subsystems and raw variables to be reinitialized, making
	damn sure to not forget anything.
</p><hr /><p>
	Whew! Second PC-98 Touhou boss completely decompiled, 29 to go, and they'll
	only get easier from here! 🎉 The next one in line, Elis, is somewhere
	between Konngara and Sariel as far as x86 instruction count is concerned, so
	that'll need to wait for some additional funding. Next up, therefore:
	Looking at <i>a thing</i> in TH03's main game code – really, I have little
	idea what it will be!
