	(Before we start: Make sure you've read the <a
	href="/faq#tsa-takedown">current version of the FAQ section on a potential
	takedown of this project</a>, updated in light of the recent DMCA claims
	against PC-98 Touhou game downloads.)
</p><hr /><p>
	Slight change of plans, because we got <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/issues/2">instructions for
	reliably reproducing the TH04 Kurumi Divide Error crash</a>! Major thanks to
	Colin Douglas Howell. With those, it also made sense to immediately look at
	the crash in the Stage 4 Marisa fight as well. This way, I could release
	both of the obligatory bugfix mods at the same time.<br />
	Especially since it turned out that I was wrong: Both crashes are entirely
	unrelated to the custom entity structure that would have required PI-centric
	progress. They are completely specific to Kurumi's and Marisa's
	{{HTML_Tag "danmaku-pattern" nil}} code, and really are two separate bugs
	with no connection to each other. All of the necessary research nicely fit
	into {{DB_CustomerByID 18}}'s 0.5 pushes, with no further deep understanding
	required here.
</p><p>
	But why were there still three weeks between Colin's message and this blog
	post? DMCA distractions aside: There are no easy fixes this time, unlike
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-29" "back when I looked at the Stage 5 Yuuka 	crash"}}.
	Just like how division by zero is undefined in mathematics, it's also,
	literally, undefined what should happen instead of these two
	<code>Divide error</code> crashes. This means that <i>any possible "fix" can
	only ever be a fanfiction interpretation of the intentions behind ZUN's
	code. The {{HTML_Tag "gameplay" nil}} community should be aware of this, and
	might decide to handle these cases differently.</i> And if we
	<i>have</i> to go into fanfiction territory to work around crashes in the
	canon games, we'd better document what exactly we're fixing here and how, as
	comprehensible as possible.
</p><hr /><p>
	With that out of the way, let's look at Kurumi's crash first, since it's way
	easier to grasp. This one is known to primarily happen to new players, and
	it's easy to see why:
</p><ul>
	<li>In one of the patterns in her third phase, Kurumi fires a series of 3
	aimed rings from both edges of the playfield. By default (that is, on Normal
	and with regular rank), these are 6-way rings.</li>
	<li>6 happens to be quite a peculiar number here, due to how rings are
	(manually) tuned based on the current "rank" value (<code>playperf</code>)
	before being fired. The code, abbreviated for clarity:
	<pre>if(bullets_in_ring >= 5) {
	if(playperf <= 10) {
		bullets_in_ring -= 2;
	}
	if(playperf <= 4) {
		bullets_in_ring -= 4;
	}
}</pre></li>
	<li>Let's look at the range of possible <code>playperf</code> values per
	difficulty level: <table class="numbers">
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>Easy</th>
			<th>Normal</th>
			<th>Hard</th>
			<th>Lunatic</th>
			<th>Extra</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><code>playperf_min</code></th>
			<td><strong>4</strong></td>
			<td>11</td>
			<td>20</td>
			<td>22</td>
			<td>16</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><code>playperf_max</code></th>
			<td>16</td>
			<td>24</td>
			<td>32</td>
			<td>34</td>
			<td>20</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p><small><strong>Edit (2022-05-24):</strong> This blog post initially had
	26 instead of 16 for <code>playperf_min</code> for the Extra Stage. Thanks
	to Popfan for pointing out that typo!</small></p></li>
	<li>Reducing rank to its minimum on Easy mode will therefore result in a
	0-ring after tuning.</li>
	<li>To calculate the individual angles of each bullet in a ring, ZUN divides
	360° (or, more correctly,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-03-05" "<code>0x100</code>"}}) by the total number of
	bullets…</li>
	<li>Boom, division by zero.</li>
</ul><figure class="fullres">
	<div class="multilayer">
		{{$k_4.TagWithIDActive "k-4"}}
		{{$k_16.TagWithID "k-16"}}
	</div>
	<figcaption>
		<span id="{{.Date}}-k"></span><br />
		<p>The pattern that causes the crash in Kurumi's fight. Also
		demonstrates how the number of bullets in a ring is always halved on
		Easy Mode after the rank-based tuning, leading to just a 3-ring on
		<code>playperf = 16</code>.</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	So, what should the workaround look like? Obviously, we want to modify
	neither the default number of ring bullets nor the tuning algorithm – that
	would change all other non-crashing variations of this pattern on other
	difficulties and ranks, creating a fork of the original gameplay. Instead, I
	came up with four possible workarounds that all seemed somewhat logical to
	me:
</p><ol>
	<li>Firing no bullet, i.e., interpreting <i>0-ring</i> literally. This would
	create the only constellation in which a call to the bullet group spawn
	functions would not spawn at least one new bullet.</li>
	<li>Firing a "1-ring", i.e., a single bullet. This would be consistent with
	how the bullet spawn functions behave for "0-way" stack and spread
	groups.</li>
	<li>Firing a "∞-ring", i.e., 200 bullets, which is as much as the game's cap
	on 16×16 bullets would allow. This would poke fun at the whole "division by
	zero" idea… but given that we're still talking about Easy Mode (and
	especially new players) here, it might be a tad too cruel. Certainly the
	most trollish interpretation.</li>
	<li>Triggering an immediate Game Over, exchanging the hard crash for a
	softer and more controlled shutdown. Certainly the option that would be
	closest to the behavior of the original games, and perhaps the only one to
	be accepted in Serious, High-Level Play™.</li>
</ol><figure class="singleplayer_playfield">

	<figcaption id="{{.Date}}-k-wa"></figcaption>
</figure><p>
	As I was writing this post, it felt increasingly wrong for me to make this
	decision. So I once again went to Twitter, where <a
	href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1512941767162798090">56.3%
	voted in favor of the 1-bullet option</a>. Good that I asked! I myself was
	more leaning towards the 0-bullet interpretation, which only got 28.7% of
	the vote. Also interesting are the 2.3% in favor of the Game Over option but
	I get it, low-rank Easy Mode isn't exactly the most competitive mode of
	playing TH04.<br />
	There are reports of Kurumi crashing on higher difficulties as well, but I
	could verify none of them. If they aren't fixed by this workaround, they're
	caused by an entirely different bug that we have yet to discover.
</p><hr /><p>
	Onto the Stage 4 Marisa crash then, which <i>does</i> in fact apply to all
	difficulty levels. I was also wrong on this one – it's a hell of a lot more
	intricate than being just a division by the number of on-screen bits.
	Without having decompiled the entire fight, I can't give a completely
	accurate picture of what happens there yet, but here's the rough idea:
</p><ul>
	<li>Marisa uses different patterns, depending on whether at least one of her
	bits <img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhIAAgAPEDAIkAAP1ERfzs7f///yH5BAUKAAMALAAAAAAgACAAAAKjnI8my5sP0Qq0UhfzpKD7imXHFnjmdwniIFjnC1hq1HLwDUJ1eeN5UusJf6OKsCeT2Hy8U1JhxG2clsBs1zSlSs3qhVV9gbBeGTlrbTDK5nInpT5XSd7YmO2l49P7dn+LwqZXFzNBlScnZniYRAbD9/jkGMn0BbV0xDhzmZUZaAUU5Rm4WYTp+RR6ekT0sIPaqvNaGbJColm6MiKXpisSVxtRAAA7"

	/> is still alive, or all of them have been destroyed.</li>
	<li>Destroying the last bit will immediately switch to the bit-less
	counterpart of the current pattern.</li>
	<li>The bits won't respawn before the pattern ended, which ensures that the
	bit-less version is always shown in its entirety after being started or
	switched into.</li>
	<li>In two of the bit-less patterns, Marisa gradually moves to the point
	reflection of her position at the start of the pattern across the playfield
	coordinate of (﻿192,&nbsp;112﻿), or (﻿224,&nbsp;128﻿) on screen.</li>
</ul><figure class="singleplayer_playfield">
	<img src="{{$m_pic}}" />
	<figcaption>Reference points for Marisa's point-reflected movement. Cyan:
	Marisa's position, green: (﻿192,&nbsp;112﻿), yellow: the intended end
	point.</figcaption>
</figure><ul>
	<li>The velocity of this movement is determined by both her distance to that
	point and the total amount of frames that this instance of the bit-less
	pattern will last.</li>
	<li>Since this frame amount is directly tied to the frame the player
	destroyed the last bit on, it becomes a user-controlled variable. I think
	you can see where this is going…</li>
	<li>The last 12 frames of this duration, however, are always reserved for a
	"braking phase", where Marisa's velocity is halved on each frame.</li>
	<li>Putting it all together, we get this formula:
	<pre>boss_velocity.x = ((192 - boss_position.x) / ((duration / 2) - (12 / 2)));
boss_velocity.y = ((112 - boss_position.y) / ((duration / 2) - (12 / 2)));</pre></li>
	<li>Set <code>duration</code> to 12 or 13, and boom, <code>Divide
	error</code>.</li>
	<li>This part of the code only runs every 4 frames though. This expands the
	time window for this crash to 4 frames, rather than just the two frames you
	would expect from looking at the division itself.</li>
	<li>Both of the broken patterns run for a maximum of 160 frames. Therefore,
	the crash will occur when Marisa's last bit is destroyed between frame 152
	and 155 inclusive. On these frames, the
	<code>last_frame_with_bits_alive</code> variable is set to 148, which is the
	crucial 12 <code>duration</code> frames away from the maximum of 160.</li>
	<li>Interestingly enough, the calculated velocity is <i>also</i> only
	applied every 4 frames, with Marisa actually staying still for the 3 frames
	inbetween. As a result, she either moves<ul>
		<li>too slowly to ever actually reach the yellow point if the last bit
		was destroyed early in the pattern (see destruction frames 68 or
		112),</li>
		<li>or way too quickly, and almost in a jerky, teleporting way (see
		destruction frames 144 or 148).</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Finally, as you may have already gathered from the formula: Destroying
	the last bit between frame 156 and 160 inclusive results in
	<code>duration</code> values of 8 or 4. These actually push Marisa
	<i>away</i> from the intended point, as the divisor becomes negative.

</figure><p>
	tl;dr: "Game crashes if last bit destroyed within 4-frame window near end of
	two patterns". For an informed decision on a new movement behavior for these
	last 8 frames, we definitely need to know all the details behind the crash
	though. Here's what I would interpret into the code:
</p><ol>
	<li>Not moving at all, i.e., interpreting 0 as the middle ground between
	positive and negative movement. This would also make sense because a
	12-frame <code>duration</code> implies 100% of the movement to consist of
	the braking phase – and Marisa wasn't moving before, after all.</li>
	<li>Move at maximum speed, i.e., dividing by 1 rather than 0. Since the
	movement duration is still 12 in this case, Marisa will immediately start
	braking. In total, she will move exactly ¾ of the way from her initial
	position to (﻿192,&nbsp;112﻿) within the 8 frames before the pattern
	ends.</li>
	<li>Directly warping to (﻿192,&nbsp;112﻿) on frame 0, and to the
	point-reflected target on 4, respectively. This "emulates" the division by
	zero by moving Marisa at infinite speed to the exact two points indicated by
	the velocity formula. It also fits nicely into the 8 frames we have to fill
	here. Sure, Marisa can't reach these points at any other duration, but why
	<i>shouldn't</i> she be able to, with infinite speed? Then again, if Marisa
	is far away enough from (﻿192,&nbsp;112﻿), this workaround would warp her
	across the entire playfield. <i>Can</i> Marisa teleport according to lore? I
	have no idea… {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}</li>
	<li>Triggering an immediate Game O– hell no, this is the Stage 4 boss,
	people <i>already</i> hate losing runs to this bug!</li>

	Asking Twitter worked great for the Kurumi workaround, so let's do it again!
	Gotta attach a screenshot of an earlier draft of this blog post though,
	since this stuff is impossible to explain in tweets…
</p><p>
	…and it <a
	href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1515018759228084229">went
	through the roof, becoming the most successful ReC98 tweet so far</a>?!
	Apparently, y'all really like to just look at descriptions of overly complex
	bugs that I'd consider way beyond the typical attention span that can be
	expected from Twitter. Unfortunately, all those tweet impressions didn't
	<i>quite</i> translate into poll turnout. The <a
	href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1515018996885688325">results</a>
	were pretty evenly split between 1) and 2), with option 1) just coming out
	slightly ahead at 49.1%, compared to 41.5% of option 2).
</p><p>
	(And yes, I only noticed after creating the poll that warping to both the
	green and yellow points made more sense than warping to just one of the two.
	Let's hope that this additional variant wouldn't have shifted the results
	too much. Both warp options only got 9.4% of the vote after all, and no one
	else came up with the idea either. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} In the end,
	you can always merge together your preferred combination of workarounds from
	the Git branches linked below.)
</p><hr /><p>
	So here you go: The new definitive version of TH04, containing not only the
	community-chosen Kurumi and Stage 4 Marisa workaround variant, but also the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-11-29" "No-EMS bugfix from last year"}}.
	<strong>Edit (2022-05-31): This package is outdated, {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "the current version is here"}}!</strong>
	{{HTML_Download .HostedPath $mod}}
	Oh, and let's also add <a
	href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a>'s TH03 GDC clock fix
	from 2019 because why not. This binary was built from the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/community_choice_fixes"><code>community_choice_fixes</code></a>
	branch, and you can find the code for all the individual workarounds on
	these branches:
</p><ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/th04_0_ring_ignore"><code>th04_0_ring_ignore</code></a></li>

</ul><p>
	Again, because it can't be stated often enough: <i>These fixes are
	fanfiction. The {{HTML_Tag "gameplay" nil}} community should be aware of
	this, and might decide to handle these cases differently.</i>
</p><hr /><p>
	With all of that taking way more time to evaluate and document, this
	research really had to become part of a proper push, instead of just being
	covered in the quick non-push blog post I initially intended. With ½ of a
	push left at the end, TH05's Stage 1-5 boss background rendering functions
	fit in perfectly there. If you wonder how these static backdrop images even
	need any boss-specific code to begin with, you're right – it's basically the
	same function copy-pasted 4 times, differing only in the backdrop image
	coordinates and some other inconsequential details.
	<br />Only Sara receives a nice variation of the typical
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-06-21" "blocky entrance animation"}}: The usually
	opaque bitmap data from <code>ST00.BB</code> is instead used as a transition
	mask from stage tiles to the backdrop image, by making clever use of the
	tile invalidation system:
</p><figure class="singleplayer_playfield">
	{{$sara.Tag}}
</figure><p>
	TH04 uses the same effect a bit more frequently, for its first three bosses.
</p><p>
	Next up: Shinki, for real this time! I've already managed to decompile 10 of
	her 11 danmaku patterns within a little more than one push – and yes,
	<i>that one</i> is included in there. Looks like I've <i>slightly</i>
	overestimated the amount of work required for TH04's and TH05's bosses…
