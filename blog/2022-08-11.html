	Wow, it's been 3 days and I'm already back with an unexpectedly long post
	about TH01's bonus point screens? 3 days used to take much longer in my
	previous projects…
</p><p>
	Before I talk about graphics for the rest of this post, let's start with the
	exact calculations for both bonuses. Touhou Wiki already got these right,
	but it still makes sense to provide them here, in a format that allows you
	to cross-reference them with the source code more easily. For the
	card-flipping stage bonus:
</p><table class="numbers"><tr>
	<th>Time</th>
	<td><code>min((</code>Stage timer<code> * 3), 6553)</code></td>
</tr><tr>
	<th>Continuous</th>
	<td><code>min((</code>Highest card combo<code> * 100), 6553)</code></td>
</tr><tr>
	<th>Bomb&Player</th>
	<td><code>min(((</code>Lives<code> * 200) + (</code>Bombs<code> * 100)), 6553)</code></td>
</tr><tr>
	<th>STAGE</th>
	<td><code>min((</code>(Stage number<code> - 1) * 200), 6553)</code></td>
</tr><tfoot><tr>
	<th>BONUS Point</th>
	<td>Sum of all above values * 10</td>
</tr></tfoot></table><p>
	The boss stage bonus is calculated from the exact same metrics, despite half
	of them being labeled differently. The only actual differences are in the
	higher multipliers and in the cap for the stage number bonus. Why remove it
	if raising it high enough also effectively disables it?

	The transition between the gameplay and TOTLE screens is one of the more
	impressive effects showcased in this game, especially due to how wavy it
	often tends to look. Aside from the palette interpolation (which is, by the
	way, the first time ZUN wrote a correct interpolation algorithm between two
	4-bit palettes), the core of the effect is quite simple. With the TOTLE
	image blitted to VRAM page 1:
</p><ul>
	<li>Shift the contents of a line on VRAM page 0 by 32 pixels, alternating
	the shift direction between <i>right edge</i> → <i>left edge</i> (even Y
	values) and the other way round (odd Y values)</li>
	<li>Keep a cursor for the destination pixels on VRAM page 1 for every line,
	starting at the respective opposite edge</li>
	<li>Blit the 32 pixels at the VRAM page 1 cursor to the newly freed 32
	pixels on VRAM page 0, and advance the cursor towards the other edge</li>
	<li>Successive line shifts will then include these newly blitted 32 pixels
	as well</li>
	<li>Repeat <code>(640 / 32) = 20</code> times, after which all new pixels
	will be in their intended place</li>
</ul><p>
	So it's really more like two interlaced shift effects with opposite
	directions, starting on different scanlines. No trigonometry involved at
	all.
</p><p>
	Horizontally scrolling pixels on a single VRAM page remains one of the few
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-06-17" "appropriate uses of the EGC in a fullscreen 640×400 PC-98 game"}},
	regardless of the copied block size. The few inter-page copies in this
	effect are also reasonable: With 8 new lines starting on each effect frame,
	up to <code>(8 × <span
		class="hovertext"
		title="amount of frames required to fully transfer a single line, see above"
	>20</span>) =</code> 160 lines are transferred at any given time, resulting
	in a maximum of <code>(160 × <span
		class="hovertext"
		title="alternating between page 0 and 1"
	>2</span> × <span
		class="hovertext"
		title="number of EGC operations required to cover 32 pixels"
	>2</span>) =</code> 640 VRAM page switches per frame for the newly
	transferred pixels. Not that frame rate matters in this situation to begin
	with though, as the game is doing nothing else while playing this effect.<br
	/>
	What <i>does</i> sort of matter: Why 32 pixels every 2 frames, instead of 16
	pixels on every frame? There's no performance difference between doing one
	half of the work in one frame, or two halves of the work in two frames. It's
	not like the overhead of another loop has a serious impact here,
	<i>especially</i> with the PC-98 VRAM being said to have rather high
	latencies. 32 pixels over 2 frames is also <i>harder</i> to code, so ZUN
	must have done it on purpose. Guess he really wanted to go for that 📽

	Once all the metrics have been calculated, ZUN animates each value with a
	rather fancy left-to-right typing effect. As 16×16 images that use a single
	<span style="color:red">bright-red color</span>, these numbers would be
	perfect candidates for gaiji… except that ZUN wanted to render them at the
	more natural Y positions of the labels inside <code>CLEAR3.GRP</code> that
	are far from aligned to the 8×16 text RAM grid. Not having been in the mood
	for hardcoding another set of monochrome sprites as C arrays that day, ZUN
	made the still reasonable choice of storing the image data for these numbers
	in the single-color .GRC form– yeah, no, of <i>course</i> he once again
	chose the .PTN hammer, and its

	Why do I bring up such a detail? What's actually going on there is that ZUN
	loops through and blits each digit from 0 to 9, and then continues the loop
	with "digit" numbers from 10 to 19, stopping before the number whose ones
	digit equals the one that should stay on screen. No problem with that in
	theory, and the .PTN <i>sprite</i> selection is correct… but the .PTN
	<i>quarter</i> selection isn't, as ZUN wrote <code>(digit % 4)</code>
	instead of the correct <code>((digit % 10) % 4)</code>.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Since .PTN quarters are indexed in a row-major
	way, the 10-19 part of the loop thus ends up blitting

		This footage was slowed down to show one sprite blitting operation per
		frame. The actual game waits a hardcoded 4 milliseconds between each
		sprite, so even theoretically, you would only see roughly every
		4<sup>th</sup> digit. And yes, we can also observe the empty quarter
		here, only blitted if one of the digits is a 9.
	</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Seriously though? If the deadline is looming and you've got to rush
	<i>some</i> part of your game, a standalone screen that doesn't affect
	anything is <i>the</i> best place to pick. At 4 milliseconds per digit, the
	animation goes by so fast that this quirk might even <i>add</i> to its
	perceived fanciness. It's exactly the reason why I've always been rather
	careful with labeling such quirks as "bugs". And in the end, the code does
	perform one more blitting call after the loop to make sure that the correct
	digit remains on screen.
</p><hr /></p>
	The remaining ¾ of the second push went towards transferring the final data
	definitions from ASM to C land. Most of the details there paint a rather
	depressing picture about ZUN's original code layout and the bloat that came
	with it, but it did end on a real highlight. There was some unused data
	between ZUN's non-master.lib VSync and text RAM code that I just moved away
	in September 2015 without taking a closer look at it. Those bytes kind of
	look like another hardcoded 1bpp image though… wait, <i>what</i>?!

	<li>Could ZUN have {{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-06" "stolen"}} the basic PC-98
	VSync or text RAM function code from a source that also implemented mouse

	… Actually, you know what, with all shared data moved to C land, I might as
	well finish <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> right now. The last secret hidden in its
	<code>main()</code> function: Just like <code>GAME.BAT</code> supports
	launching the game in various debug modes from the DOS command line,
	<code>FUUIN.EXE</code> can directly launch one of the game's endings. As
	long as the MDRV2 driver is installed, you can enter
	<code>fuuin&nbsp;t1</code> for the 魔界/Makai Good Ending, or
	<code>fuuin&nbsp;t</code> for 地獄/Jigoku Good Ending.<br />
	Unfortunately, the command-line parameter can only control the route.
	Choosing between a Good or Bad Ending is still done exclusively through
	TH01's resident structure, and the <code>continues_per_scene</code> array in
	particular. But if you pre-allocate that structure somehow and set one of
	the members to a nonzero value, it would work. <a
