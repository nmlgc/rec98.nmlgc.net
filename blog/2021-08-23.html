	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-05-27" "7 pushes to get Konngara done, according to my previous estimate?"}}
	Well, how about being twice as fast, and getting the entire boss fight done
	in 3.5 pushes instead? So much copy-pasted code in there… without any
	flashy {{HTML_Tag "unused" nil}} content, apart from four calculations with
	an unclear purpose. And the three strings <code>"ANGEL", "OF",
	"DEATH"</code>, which were probably meant to be rendered using those giant
	upscaled font ROM glyphs that also display the
	<span style="color: red">STAGE #</span> and
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> strings? Those three strings
	are also part of Sariel's code, though.

	On to the remaining 11 patterns then! Konngara's homing snakes, shown in
	the video above, are one of the more notorious parts of this battle. They
	occur in two patterns – one with two snakes and one with four – with
	<i>all</i> of the spawn, aim, update, and render code copy-pasted between
	the two. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Three gameplay-related discoveries
	here:
</p><ul>
	<li>The homing target is locked once the Y position of a snake's white head
	diamond is below 300 pixels.</li>
	<li>That diamond is also the only one with collision detection…</li>
	<li>…but comes with a gigantic 30×30 pixel hitbox, reduced to 30×20 while
	Reimu is sliding. For comparison: Reimu's regular sprite is 32×32 pixels,
	including transparent areas. This time, there <i>is</i> a clearly defined
	hitbox around Reimu's center pixel that the single top-left pixel can
	collide with. No imagination necessary, which people apparently
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-07-31" "still"}} prefer over actually understanding an
	algorithm… Then again, this hitbox is <i>still</i> not intuitive at all,
	because…
	<p></p><p class="gallery pixelated"><img

		style="height: 64px;"
		alt="Snake head with collision pixel" />
	</p>… the exact collision pixel, marked in
	<span style="color: red">red</span>, is part of the diamond sprite's
	transparent background {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}</li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	This was followed by <i>really</i> weird aiming code for the "sprayed
	pellets from cup" pattern… which can only possibly have been done on
	purpose, but is sort of mitigated by the spraying motion anyway.<br />
	After a bunch of long <code>if(…) {…} else&nbsp;if(…) {…} else&nbsp;if(…)
	{…}</code> chains, which remain quite popular in <i>certain</i> corners of
	the game dev scene to this day, we've got the three <i>sword slash</i>
	patterns as the final notable ones. At first, it seemed as if ZUN just
	improvised those raw number constants involved in the pellet spawner's
	movement calculations to describe <i>some</i> sort of path that vaguely
	resembles the sword slash. But once I tried to express these numbers in
	terms of the slash animation's keyframes, it all worked out perfectly, and
	resulted in this:

	Yup, the spawner always takes an exact path along this triangle. Sometimes,
	I wonder whether I should just rush this project and don't bother about
	naming these repeated number literals. Then I gain insights like these, and
	it's all worth it.
</p><hr /><p>
	Finally, we've got Konngara's main function, which coordinates the entire
	fight. Third-longest function in both TH01 and all of PC-98 Touhou, only
	behind some player-related stuff and YuugenMagan's gigantic main function…
	and it's even more of a copy-pasta, making it feel not nearly as long as it
	is. Key insights there:
</p><ul>
	<li>The fight consists of 7 phases, with the entire defeat sequence being
	part of the <code>if(boss_phase&nbsp;==&nbsp;7) {…}</code>
	branch.</li>
	<li>The three even-numbered phases, however, only light up the Siddhaṃ seed
	syllables and then progress to the next phase.</li>
	<li>Odd-numbered phases are completed after passing an HP threshold or after
	seeing a predetermined number of patterns, whatever happens first. No
	possibility of skipping anything there.</li>
	<li>Patterns are chosen randomly, but the available <i>pool</i> of patterns
	is limited to 3 specific "easier" patterns in phases 1 and 5, and 4 patterns
	in phase 3. Once Phase 7 is reached at 9 HP remaining, all 12 patterns can
	potentially appear. Fittingly, that's also the point where the red section
	of the HP bar starts.<ul>
		<li>Every time a pattern is chosen, the code only makes a maximum of two
		attempts at picking a pattern that's different from the one that
		Konngara just completed. Therefore, it seems entirely possible to see
		the same pattern twice. Calculating an actual seed to prove that is out
		of the scope of this project, though.</li>
		<li>Due to what looks like a copy-paste mistake, the pool for the second
		RNG attempt in phases 5 and 7 is reduced to only the first two patterns
		of the respective phases? That's already quite some bias right there,
		and we haven't even analyzed the RNG in detail yet…
		{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} (For anyone interested, it's a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Parameters_in_common_use">LCG,
		using the <i>Borland C/C++</i> parameters as shown here</a>.)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The difficulty level only affects the speed and firing intervals (and
	thus, number) of pellets, as well as the number of lasers in the one pattern
	that uses them.</li>
	<li>After the {{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-07" "kuji-in defeat sequence"}}, the
	fight ends in an attempted double-<code>free</code> of Konngara's image
	data. {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} Thankfully, the format-specific
	<code>_free()</code> functions defend against such a thing.</li>
</ul><p>
	Seriously, {{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-14" "line drawing"}} was much harder to
	decompile.
</p><hr /><p>
	And that's it for Konngara! First boss with not a single piece of ASM left,
	30 more to go! 🎉 But wait, what about the cause behind the temporary green
	discoloration after leaving the Pause menu? I expected to find something on
	that as well, but nope, it's nothing in Konngara's code segment. We'll
	probably only get to figure that out near the very end of TH01's
	decompilation, once we get to the one function that directly calls all of
	the boss-specific main functions in a <code>switch</code> statement.
</p><p>
	So, Sariel next? With half of a push left, I did cover Sariel's first few
	initialization functions, but all the sprite unblitting and HUD
	manipulation will need some extra attention first. The first one of these
	functions is related to the HUD, the stage timer, and the
	<span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span> mode, whose pellet pattern I've
	also decompiled now.
</p><p>
	All of this brings us past 75% PI in all games, and TH01 to under 30,000
	remaining ASM instructions, leaving TH03 as the now most expensive game to
	be completely decompiled. Looking forward to how much more TH01's code will
	fall apart if you just tap it lightly… Next up: The aforementioned helper
	functions related to <span style="color: red">HARRY UP</span>, drawing the
	HUD, and unblitting the other bosses whose sprites are a bit more animated.
</p>
