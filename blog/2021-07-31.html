	…or maybe not <i>that</i> soon, as it would have only wasted time to
	untangle the bullet update commits from the rest of the progress. So,
	here's <i>all</i> the bullet spawning code in TH04 and TH05 instead. I hope
	you're ready for this, there's a lot to talk about!

	and all 16×16 bullets loaded from <code>MIKO16.BFT</code>, nothing else.)
</p><hr /><p>
	But first, what was going <i>on</i>
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-16" "in 2020"}}? Spent 4 pushes on the basic types
	and constants back then, still ended up confusing a couple of things, and
	even getting some wrong. Like how TH05's "bullet slowdown" flag actually
	always <i>prevents</i> slowdown and fires bullets at a constant speed
	instead. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} Or how "random spread" is not the
	best term to describe that unused bullet group type in TH04.<br />
	Or that there are two distinct ways of clearing all bullets on screen,
	which deserve different names:

</div><p>
	Bullets are <i>zapped</i> at the end of most midboss and boss phases, and
	<i>cleared</i> everywhere else – most notably, during bombs, when losing a
	life, or as rewards for extends or a maximized Dream bonus. The <i>
	Bonus!!</i> points awarded for zapping bullets are calculated iteratively,
	so it's not trivial to give an exact formula for these. For a small number
	𝑛 of bullets, it would exactly be 5𝑛³&nbsp;-&nbsp;10𝑛²&nbsp;+&nbsp;15𝑛
	points – or, using uth05win's (correct) recursive definition, <code>
	Bonus(𝑛) = Bonus(𝑛-1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;15𝑛²&nbsp;-&nbsp;5𝑛&nbsp;+&nbsp;10</code>.
	However, one of the internal step variables is capped at a different number
	of points for each difficulty (and game), after which the points only
	increase linearly. Hence, "semi-exponential".
</p><hr /><p>
	On to TH04's bullet spawn code then, because that one can at least be
	decompiled. And immediately, we have to deal with a pointless distinction
	between <i>regular</i> bullets, with either a decelerating or constant
	velocity, and <i>special</i> bullets, with preset velocity changes during
	their lifetime. That preset has to be set <i>somewhere</i>, so why have
	separate functions? In TH04, this separation continues even down to the
	lowest level of functions, where values are written into the global bullet
	array. TH05 merges those two functions into one, but then goes too far and
	uses self-modifying code to save a grand total of two local variables…
	Luckily, the rest of its actual code is identical to TH04.
</p><p>
	Most of the complexity in bullet spawning comes from the (thankfully
	shared) helper function that calculates the velocities of the individual
	bullets within a group. Both games handle each group type via a large
	<code>switch</code> statement, which is where TH04 shows off another Turbo
	C++ 4.0 optimization: If the range of <code>case</code> values is too
	sparse to be meaningfully expressed in a jump table, it usually generates a
	linear search through a second value table. But with the <code>-G</code>
	command-line option, it instead generates branching code for a binary
	search through the set of cases. 𝑂(log&nbsp;𝑛) as the worst case for a
	<code>switch</code> statement in a C++ compiler from 1994… that's so cool.
	But still, why are the values in TH04's group type <code>enum</code> all
	over the place to begin with? {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}<br />
	Unfortunately, this optimization is pretty rare in PC-98 Touhou. It only
	shows up here and in a few places in TH02, compared to at least 50
	<code>switch</code> value tables.
</p><p>
	In all of its micro-optimized pointlessness, TH05's undecompilable version
	at least fixes some of TH04's redundancy. While it's still not even
	<i>optimal</i>, it's at least a decently <i>written</i> piece of ASM…
	<i>if</i> you take the time to understand what's going on there, because it
	certainly took quite a bit of that to verify that all of the things which
	looked like bugs or quirks were in fact correct. And that's how the code
	for this function ended up with 35% comments and blank lines before I could
	confidently call it "reverse-engineered"…<br />
	Oh well, at least it finally fixes a correctness issue from TH01 and TH04,
	where an invalid bullet group type would fill all remaining slots in the
	bullet array with identical versions of the first bullet.
</p><p>
	Something that both games also share in these functions is an over-reliance
	on globals for return values or other local state. The most ridiculous
	example here: Tuning the speed of a bullet based on rank actually mutates
	the global bullet template… which ZUN then works around by adding a wrapper
	function around both regular and special bullet spawning, which saves the
	base speed before executing that function, and restores it afterward.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Add another set of wrappers to bypass that exact
	tuning, and you've expanded your nice 1-function interface to 4 functions.
	Oh, and did I mention that TH04 pointlessly duplicates the first set of
	wrapper functions for 3 of the 4 difficulties, which can't even be
	explained with "debugging reasons"? That's 10 functions then… and probably
	explains why I've procrastinated this feature for so long.
</p><p>
	At this point, I also finally stopped decompiling ZUN's original ASM just
	for the sake of it. All these small TH05 functions would look horribly
	unidiomatic, are identical to their decompiled TH04 counterparts anyway,
	except for some unique constant… and, in the case of TH05's rank-based
	speed tuning function, actually <i>become</i> undecompilable as soon as we
	want to return a C++ class to preserve the semantic meaning of the return
	value. Mainly, this is because Turbo C++ does not allow register
	pseudo-variables like <code>_AX</code> or <code>_AL</code> to be cast into
	class types, even if their size matches. Decompiling that function would
	have therefore lowered the quality of the rest of the decompiled code, in
	exchange for the additional maintenance and compile-time cost of another
	translation unit. Not worth it – and for a TH05 port, you'd already have to
	decompile all the rest of the bullet spawning code anyway!
</p><hr /><p>
	The only thing in there that <i>was</i> still somewhat worth being
	decompiled was the pre-spawn clipping and collision detection function. Due
	to what's probably a micro-optimization mistake, the TH05 version continues
	to spawn a bullet even if it was spawned on top of the player. This might
	sound like it has a different effect on gameplay… until you realize that
	the player got hit in this case and will either lose a life or deathbomb,
	both of which will cause all on-screen bullets to be <i>cleared</i> anyway.
	So it's at most a visual glitch.
</p><p>
	But while we're at it, can we please stop talking about hitboxes? At least
	in the context of TH04 and TH05 bullets. The actual collision detection is
	described way better as a kill <i>delta</i> of 8×8 pixels between the
	center points of the player and a bullet. You can distribute these pixels
	to any combination of bullet and player "hitboxes" that make up 8×8. 4×4
	around both the player and bullets? 1×1 for bullets, and 8×8 for the
	player? All equally valid… or perhaps none of them, once you keep in mind
	that other entity types might have different kill deltas. With that in
	mind, the concept of a "hitbox" turns into just a confusing abstraction.
</p><p>
	The same is true for the 36×44 graze <s>box</s> delta. For some reason,
	this one is not exactly  around the center of a bullet, but shifted to the
	right by 2 pixels. So, a bullet can be grazed up to 20 pixels right of the
	player, but only up to 16 pixels left of the player. uth05win also spotted
	this… and rotated the deltas clockwise by 90°?!
</p><hr /><p>
	Which brings us to the bullet updates… for which I <i>still</i> had to
	research a decompilation workaround, because
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-07-20" "P0148"}} turned out to not help at all?
	Instead, the solution was to lie to the compiler about the true segment
	distance of the popup function and declare its signature <code>far</code>
	rather than <code>near</code>. This allowed ZUN to save that <span
		class="hovertext"
		title="Hint: There is no difference in the amount of x86 opcode bytes.">
	<i>ridiculous</i> overhead</span> of 1 additional <code>far</code> function
	call/return per frame, and those <i>precious</i> 2 bytes in the BSS segment
	that he didn't have to spend on a segment value.
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-04" "Another function"}} that didn't have just a
	single declaration in a common header file… really,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-01-06" "how were these games even <i>built</i>???"}}
</p><p>
	The function itself is among the longer ones in both games. It especially
	stands out in the indentation department, with 7 levels at its most
	indented point – and that's the <i>minimum</i> of what's possible without
	<code>goto</code>. Only two more notable discoveries there:
</p><ol>
	<li>Bullets are the only entity affected by Slow Mode. If the number of
	bullets on screen is ≥ <code>(24 + (difficulty * 8) + rank)</code> in TH04,
	or <code>(42 + (difficulty * 8))</code> in TH05, Slow Mode reduces the frame
	rate by 33%, by waiting for one additional VSync event every two frames.
	<br />
	The code also reveals a second tier, with 50% slowdown for a slightly
	higher number of bullets, but that conditional branch can never be executed
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}</li>
	<li>Bullets must have been grazed in a previous frame before they can
	be collided with. (Note how this does not apply to bullets that spawned
	on top of the player, as explained earlier!)</li>
</ol><p>
	Whew… When did ReC98 turn into a full-on code review?! 😅 And after all
	this, we're <i>still</i> not done with TH04 and TH05 bullets, with all the
	special movement types still missing. That should be less than one push
	though, once we get to it. Next up: Back to TH01 and Konngara! Now have fun
	rewriting the Touhou Wiki Gameplay pages 😛
