	What's this? A simple, straightforward, easy-to-decompile TH01 boss with
	just a few minor quirks and only two rendering-related ZUN bugs? Yup, 2½
	pushes, and Kikuri was done. Let's get right into the overview:
</p><ul>
	<li>Just like {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "Elis"}}, Kikuri's fight consists
	of 5 phases, excluding the entrance animation. For some reason though, they
	are numbered from 2 to 6 this time, skipping phase 1? For consistency, I'll
	use the original phase numbers from the source code in this blog post.</li>
	<li>The main phases (2, 5, and 6) also share Elis' HP boundaries of 10, 6,
	and 0, respectively, and are once again indicated by different colors in the
	HP bar. They immediately end upon reaching the given number of HP, making
	Kikuri immune to the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "debug mode heap corruption that can happen with Elis and Konngara"}}.</li>
	<li>Phase 2 solely consists of the infamous big symmetric spiral
	pattern.</li>
	<li>Phase 3 fades Kikuri's ball of light from its default <span
	style="color: #bbbbff">bluish color</span> to <span style="color:
	#ffbbaa">bronze</span> over 100 frames. Collision detection is deactivated
	during this phase.</li>
	<li>In Phase 4, Kikuri activates her two souls while shooting the spinning
	8-pellet circles from the previously activated ball. The phase ends shortly
	after the souls fired their third spread pellet group.<ul>
		<li>Note that this is a timed phase without an HP boundary, which makes
		it possible to reduce Kikuri's HP below the boundaries of the next
		phases, effectively skipping them. Take <a
		href="https://youtu.be/gh20KvvEgMM?t=39">this video</a> for example,
		where Kikuri has 6 HP by the end of Phase 4, and therefore directly
		starts Phase 6.<br />
		(Obviously, Kikuri's HP can also be reduced to 0 or below, which will
		end the fight immediately after this phase.)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Phase 5 combines the teardrop/ripple "pattern" from the souls with the
	"two crossed eye laser" pattern, on independent cycles.</li>
	<li>Finally, Kikuri cycles through her remaining 4 patterns in Phase 6,
	while the souls contribute single aimed pellets every 200 frames.</li>
	<li>Interestingly, all HP-bounded phases come with an additional hidden
	timeout condition:<ul>
		<li>Phase 2 automatically ends after 6 cycles of the spiral pattern, or
		5,400 frames in total.</li>
		<li>Phase 5 ends after 1,600 frames, or the first frame of the
		7<sup>th</sup> cycle of the two crossed red lasers.</li>
		<li>If you manage to keep Kikuri alive for 29 of her Phase 6 patterns,
		her HP are automatically set to 1. The HP bar isn't redrawn when this
		happens, so there is no visual indication of this timeout condition even
		existing – apart from the next Orb hit ending the fight regardless of
		the displayed HP. Due to the deterministic order of patterns, this
		always happens on the 8<sup>th</sup> cycle of the "symmetric gravity
		pellet lines from both souls" pattern, or 11,800 frames. If dodging and
		avoiding orb hits for 3½ minutes sounds tiring, you can always watch the
		byte at <code>DS:0x1376</code> in your emulator's memory viewer. Once
		it's at <code>0x1E</code>, you've reached this timeout.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>
	So yeah, there's your new timeout challenge. {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}
</p><hr /><p>
	The few issues in this fight all relate to hitboxes, starting with the main
	one of Kikuri against the Orb. The coordinates in the code clearly describe
	a hitbox in the upper center of the disc, but then ZUN wrote a &lt; sign
	instead of a &gt; sign, resulting in an in-game hitbox that's not
	<i>quite</i> where it was intended to be…

</figure><p>
	Much worse, however, are the teardrop ripples. It already starts with their
	rendering routine, which places the sprites from <code>TAMAYEN.PTN</code>
	<img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhIAAQAKEDAMAwoKDQ8PDw8P///yH5BAEKAAMALAAAAAAgABAAAAJlnI9pYXI+mJp0OCZzrQ5aC4Wbgn1BKWgjEqRpdGLtux7xmcYpENcHD7zFeAGAzwAEBJPK4ufRADWU1KpVCY0sYJ+rl6p5uXDIr7clTA/N1xtRfWK3h/SivSiv2sH8e/5vhQcIUAAAOw=="
	/> at byte-aligned VRAM positions in the ultimate piece of <code>if(…) {…}
	else&nbsp;if(…) {…} else&nbsp;if(…) {…}</code> meme code. Rather than
	tracking the position of each of the five ripple sprites, ZUN suddenly went
	purely functional and manually hardcoded the exact rendering and collision
	detection calls for each frame of the animation, based on nothing but its
	total frame counter. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	Each of the (up to) 5 columns is also unblitted and blitted individually
	before moving to the next column, starting at the center and then
	symmetrically moving out to the left and right edges. This wouldn't be a
	problem <i>if ZUN's EGC-powered unblitting function didn't word-align its X
	coordinates to a 16×1 grid</i>. If the ripple sprites happen to start at an
	odd VRAM byte position, their unblitting coordinates get rounded both down
	and up to the nearest 16 pixels, thus touching the adjacent 8 pixels of the
	previously blitted columns and leaving the well-known black vertical bars in
	their place. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	OK, so where's the hitbox issue here? If you just look at the raw
	calculation, it's a slightly confusingly expressed, but perfectly logical 17
	pixels. But this is where byte-aligned blitting has a direct effect on
	gameplay: These ripples can be spawned at any arbitrary, non-byte-aligned
	VRAM position, and collisions are calculated relative to this internal
	position. Therefore, the actual hitbox is shifted up to 7 pixels to the
	right, compared to where you would expect it from a ripple sprite's
	on-screen position:
</p><figure class="th01_playfield">
	<video loop controls>{{$vid_ripple.Body}}</video>
	<figcaption>Due to the deterministic nature of this part of the fight, it's
	always 5 pixels for this first set of ripples. These visualizations are
	obviously not pixel-perfect due to the different potential, shapes of
	Reimu's sprite, so they instead relate to her 32×32 bounding box, which
	needs to be entirely inside the <span style="color: red">red
	area</span>.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	We've previously seen the same issue with the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "shot hitbox of Elis' bat form"}}, where
	pixel-perfect collision detection against a byte-aligned sprite was merely a
	sidenote compared to the more serious X=Y coordinate bug. So why do I
	elevate it to bug status here? Because it directly affects dodging: Reimu's
	regular movement speed is 4 pixels per frame, and with the internal position
	of an on-screen ripple sprite varying by up to 7 pixels, any micrododging
	(or "grazing") attempt turns into a coin flip. It's <i>sort of</i> mitigated
	by the fact that Reimu is <i>also</i> only ever rendered at byte-aligned
	VRAM positions, but I wouldn't say that these two bugs cancel out each
	other.<br />
	Oh well, another set of rendering issues to be fixed in the hypothetical
	Anniversary Edition – obviously, the hitboxes should remain unchanged. Until
	then, you can always memorize the exact internal positions. The sequence of
	teardrop spawn points is completely deterministic and only controlled by the
	fixed per-difficulty spawn interval.
</p><hr /><p>
	Aside from more minor coordinate inaccuracies, there's not much of interest
	in the rest of the pattern code. In another parallel to Elis though, the
	first soul pattern in phase 4 is aimed on every difficulty <i>except</i>
	Lunatic, where the pellets are once again statically fired downwards. This
	time, however, the pattern's difficulty is much more appropriately
	distributed across the four levels, with the simultaneous spinning circle
	pellets adding a constant aimed component to every difficulty level.

</p><hr /><p>
	That brings us to 5 fully decompiled PC-98 Touhou bosses, with 26 remaining…
	and another ½ of a push going to the cutscene code in
	<code>FUUIN.EXE</code>.<br />
	You wouldn't expect something as mundane as the boss slideshow code to
	contain anything interesting, but there is in fact a slight bit of
	speculation fuel there. The text typing functions take explicit string
	lengths, which precisely match the corresponding strings… for the most part.
	For the <code>"Gatekeeper 'SinGyoku'"</code> string though, ZUN passed 23
	characters, not 22. Could that have been the "h" from the Hepburn
	romanization of <span lang="ja">神玉</span>?!<br />
	Also, <i>come on</i>, if this text is already blitted to VRAM for no reason,
	you could have gone for perfect centering at unaligned byte positions; the
	rendering function would have perfectly supported it. Instead, the X
	coordinates are still rounded up to the nearest byte.
</p><p>
	The hardcoded ending cutscene functions should be even less interesting –
	don't they just show a bunch of images followed by frame delays? Until they
	don't, and we reach the <span lang="ja">地獄</span>/Jigoku Bad Ending with
	its special shake/"boom" effect, and this picture:
</p><figure>
	<img src="{{$pic2}}" />
	<figcaption>Picture #2 from <code>ED2A.GRP</code>.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Which is rendered by the following code:
</p><pre>for(int i = 0; i <= boom_duration; i++) { // (yes, off-by-one)
	if((i & 3) == 0) {
		graph_scrollup(8);
	} else {
		graph_scrollup(0);
	}

	end_pic_show(1); // ← different picture is rendered
	frame_delay(2);  // ← blocks until 2 VSync interrupts have occurred

	if(i & 1) {
		end_pic_show(2); // ← picture above is rendered
	} else {
		end_pic_show(1);
	}
}</pre><p>
	Notice something? <i>You should never see this picture because it's
	immediately overwritten before the frame is supposed to end.</i> And yet
	it's clearly flickering up for about one frame with common emulation
	settings as well as on my real PC-9821 Nw133, clocked at 133 MHz.
	master.lib's <code>graph_scrollup()</code> doesn't block until VSync either,
	and removing these calls doesn't change anything about the blitted images.
	<code>end_pic_show()</code> uses the EGC to blit the given 320×200 quarter
	of VRAM from page 1 to the visible page 0, so the bottleneck shouldn't be
	there either…
</p><p>
	…or should it? After setting it up via a few I/O port writes, the common
	method of EGC-powered blitting works like this:
</p><ol>
	<li>Read 16 bits from the source VRAM position on <i>any single</i>
	bitplane. This fills the EGC's 4 16-bit tile registers with the VRAM
	contents at that specific position on <i>every</i> bitplane. You do not care
	about the value the CPU returns from the read – in optimized code, you would
	make sure to just read into a register to avoid useless additional stores
	into local variables.</li>
	<li>Write <span class="hovertext" title="Yes, it doesn't even have to be the value you got back during the previous read."><i>any</i> 16 bits</span>
	to the target VRAM position on <i>any single</i> bitplane. This copies the
	contents of the EGC's tile registers to that specific position on
	<i>every</i> bitplane.</li>
</ol><p>
	To transfer pixels from one VRAM page to another, you insert an additional
	write to I/O port <code>0xA6</code> before 1) and 2) to set your source and
	destination page… and that's where we find the bottleneck. Taking a look at
	the i486 CPU and its <a
	href="https://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~fpf/Uebungen/GdR-SS02/opcode_i.html">cycle
	counts</a>, a single one of these page switches costs 17 cycles – 1 for
	<code>MOV</code>ing the page number into <code>AL</code>, and 16 for the
	<code>OUT</code> instruction itself. Therefore, the 8,000 page switches
	required for EGC-copying a 320×200-pixel image require 136,000 cycles in
	total.
</p><p>
	And that's the <i>optimal</i> case of using <i>only</i> those two
	instructions. {{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "As I implied last time"}}, TH01
	uses a <i>function call</i> for VRAM page switches, complete with creating
	and destroying a useless stack frame and unnecessarily updating a global
	variable in main memory. I tried optimizing ZUN's code by throwing out
	unnecessary code and using {{Blog_PostLink "2022-02-18" "pseudo-registers"}}
	to generate probably optimal assembly code, and that did speed up the
	blitting to almost exactly 50% of the original version's run time. However,
	it did little about the flickering itself. Here's a comparison of the first
	loop with <code>boom_duration = 16</code>, recorded in DOSBox-X with
	<code>cputype=auto</code> and <code>cycles=max</code>, and with
	<code>i</code> overlaid using the text chip. Caution, flashing lights:

</figure><p>
	I pushed the optimized code to the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/tree/th01_end_pic_optimize"><code>th01_end_pic_optimize</code></a>
	branch, to also serve as an example of how to get close to optimal code out
	of Turbo C++ 4.0J without writing a single ASM instruction.<br />
	And if you really want to use the EGC for this, that's the best you can do.
	It really sucks that it merely expanded the GRCG's 4×8-bit tile register to
	4×16 bits. With 32 bits, ≥386 CPUs could have taken advantage of their wider
	registers and instructions to double the blitting performance. Instead, we
	now know the reason why
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-06" "Promisence Soft's EGC-powered sprite driver that ZUN later stole for TH03"}}
	is called SPRITE16 and not SPRITE32. What a massive disappointment.
</p><p>
	But what's perhaps a bigger surprise: <i>Blitting <span
	title="as seen in the on-disk layout of the .CDG and .CD2 files used in later games">planar
	images</span> from main memory is much faster than EGC-powered inter-page
	VRAM copies</i>, despite the required manual access to all 4 bitplanes. In
	fact, the blitting functions for the .CDG/.CD2 format, used from TH03
	onwards, would later demonstrate the optimal method of using <code>REP
	MOVSD</code> for blitting every line in 32-pixel chunks. If that was also
	used for these ending images, the core blitting operation would have taken
	<code>((12&nbsp;+&nbsp;(3&nbsp;×&nbsp;(<span
		class="hovertext"
		title="width in pixels">320</span>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<span
		class="hovertext"
		title="1bpp pixels blitted per MOVSD instruction"
	>32</span>)))&nbsp;×&nbsp;<span
		class="hovertext" title="height in pixels">200</span>&nbsp;×&nbsp;<span
		class="hovertext" title="number of bitplanes">4</span>) =
	33,600</code> cycles, with not much more overhead for the surrounding row
	and bitplane loops. Sure, this doesn't factor in the whole infamous issue of
	VRAM being slow on PC-98, but the aforementioned 136,000 cycles don't even
	include any <i>actual blitting</i> either. And as you move up to later PC-98
	models with Pentium CPUs, the gap between <code>OUT</code> and <code>REP
	MOVSD</code> only becomes larger. (Note that the page I linked above has a
	typo in the cycle count of <code>REP MOVSD</code> on Pentium CPUs: According
	to the original Intel <cite>Architecture and Programming Manual</cite>, it's
	<code>13﻿+﻿𝑛</code>, not <code>3﻿+﻿𝑛</code>.)<br />
	This difference explains why later games rarely use EGC-"accelerated"
	inter-page VRAM copies, and keep all of their larger images in main memory.
	It especially explains why TH04 and TH05 can get away with naively redrawing
	boss backdrop images on every frame.
</p><p>
	In the end, the whole fact that ZUN did not define how long this image
	should be visible is enough for me to increment the game's overall bug
	counter. Who would have thought that looking at <i>endings</i> of all things
	would teach us a PC-98 performance lesson… Sure, optimizing TH01 already
	seemed promising just by looking at its bloated code, but I had no idea that
	its performance issues extended so far past that level.
</p><p>
	That only leaves the common beginning part of all endings and a short
	<code>main()</code> function before we're done with <code>FUUIN.EXE</code>,
	and 98 functions until all of TH01 is decompiled! Next up: SinGyoku, who not
	only is the quickest boss to defeat in-game, but also comes with the least
	amount of code. See you very soon!
