<p>
	The important things first:
</p><ul>
	<li>TH05 has passed the 50% RE mark, with both <code>MAIN.EXE</code> and the
	game as a whole! With that, we've also reached what {{DB_CustomerByID 2}}
	wanted out of the project, so he's suspending his discount offer for a
	bit.</li>
	<li><i>Curve bullets</i> are now officially called <i>cheetos</i>! <a
	href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1500256959785746434">76.7% of
	fans prefer this term</a>, and it fits into the 8.3 DOS filename scheme much
	better than <i>homing lasers</i> (as they're called in
	<code>OMAKE.TXT</code>) or <i><a
	href="https://twitter.com/armormodechang/status/1500907580914343943">Taito
	lasers</a></i> (which would indeed have made sense as well).</li>
	<li>…oh, and I managed to decompile Shinki within 2 pushes after all. That
	left enough budget to also add the Stage 1 midboss on top.</li>
</ul><p>
	So, Shinki! As far as final boss code is concerned, she's surprisingly
	economical, with {{Blog_PostLink "2021-06-10" "her background animations"}}
	making up more than ⅓ of her entire code. Going straight from TH01's
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-08-23" "final"}}
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-01-31" "bosses"}}
	to TH05's final boss definitely showed how much ZUN had streamlined
	danmaku pattern code by the end of PC-98 Touhou. Don't get me wrong, there
	is still room for improvement: TH05 not only
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-03-27" "reuses the same 16 bytes of generic boss state we saw in TH04 last month"}},
	but also uses them 4× as often, and even for midbosses. Most importantly
	though, defining danmaku patterns using a single global instance of the
	group template structure is just bad no matter how you look at it:
</p><ul>
	<li>The script code ends up rather bloated, with a single <code>MOV</code>
	instruction for setting one of the fields taking up 5 bytes. By comparison,
	the entire structure for regular bullets is 14 bytes large, while the
	template structure for Shinki's 32×32 ball bullets could have easily been
	reduced to 8 bytes.</li>
	<li>Since it's also one piece of global state, you can easily forget to set
	one of the required fields for a group type. The resulting danmaku group
	then reuses these values from the last time they were set… which might have
	been as far back as another boss fight from a previous stage.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} And of course, I wouldn't point this out if it
	didn't actually happen in Shinki's pattern code. Twice.</li>
</ul><p>
	Declaring a separate structure instance with the static data for every
	pattern would be both safer <i>and</i> more space-efficient, and there's
	more than enough space left for that in the game's data segment.<br />
	But all in all, the pattern functions are short, sweet, and easy to follow.
	The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8UHzPi4K7c&t=136s">"devil"
	pattern</a> <i>is</i> significantly more complex than the others, but still
	far from TH01's final bosses at their worst. I especially like the clear
	architectural separation between "one-shot pattern" functions that return
	<code>true</code> once they're done, and "looping pattern" functions that
	run as long as they're being called from a boss's main function. Not many
	all too interesting things in these pattern functions for the most part,
	except for two pieces of evidence that Shinki was coded after Yumeko:
</p><ul>
	<li>The gather animation function in the first two phases contains a bullet
	group configuration that <i>looks</i> like it's part of an unused danmaku
	pattern. It quickly turns out to just be copy-pasted from a similar function
	in Yumeko's fight though, where it <i>is</i> turned into actual
	bullets.</li>
	<li>As one of the two places where ZUN forgot to set a template field, the
	lasers at the end of the white wing preparation pattern reuse the 6-pixel
	width of Yumeko's final laser pattern. This actually has an effect on
	gameplay: Since these lasers are active for the first 8 frames after
	Shinki's wings appear on screen, the player can get hit by them in the last
	2 frames after they grew to their final width.
		<figure class="singleplayer_playfield">
			{{call .VideoPlayer $vid}}
			<figcaption>Of course, there are more than enough safespots <i>between</i> the lasers.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div></li>
</ul><hr /><p>
	Speaking about that wing sprite: If you look at <code>ST05.BB2</code> (or
	any other file with a large sprite, for that matter), you notice a rather
	weird file layout:
</p><figure class="pixelated checkerboard">
	<img
	src="{{$pic1}}"
	alt="Raw file layout of TH05's ST05.BB2, demonstrating master.lib's supposed BFNT width limit of 64 pixels"
	style="height: 384px;" />
	<figcaption>A large sprite split into multiple smaller ones with a width of
	64 pixels each? What's this, hardware sprite limitations? On <i>my</i>
	PC-98?!</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	And it's not a limitation of the sprite width field in the BFNT+ header
	either. Instead, it's master.lib's BFNT functions which are limited to
	sprite widths up to 64 pixels… or at least that's what
	<code>MASTER.MAN</code> claims. Whatever the restriction was, it seems to be
	completely nonexistent as of master.lib version 0.23, and none of the
	master.lib functions used by the games have any issues with larger
	sprites.<br />
	Since ZUN stuck to the supposed 64-pixel width limit though, it's now the
	<i>game</i> that expects Shinki's winged form to consist of 4 physical
	sprites, not just 1. Any conversion from another, more logical sprite sheet
	layout back into BFNT+ must therefore replicate the original number of
	sprites. Otherwise, the sequential IDs ("patnums") assigned to every newly
	loaded sprite no longer match ZUN's hardcoded IDs, causing the game to
	crash. This is exactly what used to happen with {{DB_CustomerByID 2}}'s
	<a href="http://lunarcast.net/mystictk.php">MysticTK automation scripts</a>,
	which combined these exact sprites into a single large one. This issue has
	now been fixed – just in case there are some underground modders out there
	who used these scripts and wonder why their game crashed as soon as the
	Shinki fight started.
</p><hr /><p>
	And then the code quality takes a nosedive with Shinki's main function.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Even in TH05, these boss and midboss update
	functions are still very imperative:
</p><ul>
	<li>The origin point of all bullet types used by a boss must be manually set
	to the current boss/midboss position; there is no concept of a bullet type
	tracking a certain entity.</li>
	<li>The same is true for the target point of a player's homing shots…</li>
	<li>… and updating the HP bar. At least the initial fill animation is
	abstracted away rather decently.</li>
	<li>Incrementing the phase frame variable also must be done manually. TH05
	even "innovates" here by giving the boss update function exclusive ownership
	of that variable, in contrast to TH04 where that ownership is given out to
	the player shot collision detection (?!) and boss defeat helper
	functions.</li>
	<li>Speaking about collision detection: That is done by calling different
	functions depending on whether the boss is supposed to be invincible or
	not.</li>
	<li>Timeout conditions? No standard way either, and all done with manual
	<code>if</code> statements. In combination with the regular phase end
	condition of lowering (mid)boss HP to a certain value, this leads to quite a
	convoluted control flow.</li>
	<li>The manual calls to the score bonus functions for cleared phases at least provide some sense of orientation. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}</li>
	<li>One potentially nice aspect of all this imperative freedom is that
	phases can end outside of HP boundaries… by manually incrementing the
	phase variable and resetting the phase <i>frame</i> variable to 0.
	{{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}</li>
</ul><p>
	The biggest WTF in there, however, goes to using one of the 16 state bytes
	as a "relative phase" variable for differentiating between boss phases that
	share the same branch within the <code>switch(boss.phase)</code>
	statement. While it's commendable that ZUN tried to reduce code duplication
	for once, he could have just branched depending on the actual
	<code>boss.phase</code> variable? The same state byte is then reused in the
	"devil" pattern to track the activity state of the big jerky lasers in the
	second half of the pattern. If you somehow managed to end the phase after
	the first few bullets of the pattern, but before these lasers are up,
	Shinki's update function would think that you're still in the phase
	<i>before</i> the "devil" pattern. The main function then sequence-breaks
	right to the defeat phase, skipping the final pattern with the burning Makai
	background. Luckily, the HP boundaries are far away enough to make this
	impossible in practice.<br />
	The takeaway here: If you <i>want</i> to use the state bytes for your custom
	boss script mods, alias them to your own 16-byte structure, and limit each
	of the bytes to a clearly defined meaning across your entire boss script.
</p><p>
	One final discovery that doesn't seem to be documented anywhere yet: Shinki
	actually has a hidden bomb shield during her two purple-wing phases.
	uth05win got this part slightly wrong though: It's not a <i>complete</i>
	shield, and hitting Shinki will still deal 1 point of chip damage per
	frame. For comparison, the first phase lasts for 3,000 HP, and the "devil"
	pattern phase lasts for 5,800 HP.
</p><p>
	And there we go, 3rd PC-98 Touhou <span class="hovertext" title="The foreground sprite rendering is still in ASM, but that's 100% boilerplate code.">boss
	script*</span> decompiled, 28 to go! 🎉 In case you were expecting a fix for
	the <a href="https://youtu.be/b1k82w1VzUc">Shinki death glitch</a>: That one
	is more appropriately fixed as part of the Mai & Yuki script. It also
	requires new code, should ideally look a bit prettier than just removing
	cheetos between one frame and the next, and I'd still like it to fit within
	the original position-dependent code layout… Let's do that some other
	time.<br />
	Not much to say about the Stage 1 midboss, or midbosses in general even,
	except that their update functions have to imperatively handle even more
	subsystems, due to the relative lack of helper functions.
</p><hr /><p>
	The remaining ¾ of the third push went to a bunch of smaller RE and
	finalization work that would have hardly got any attention otherwise, to
	help secure that 50% RE mark. The nicest piece of code in there shows off
	what looks like the optimal way of setting up the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-12-18" "GRCG tile register"}} for monochrome blitting
	in a variable color:
</p><pre>mov ah, palette_index ; Any other non-AL 8-bit register works too.
                      ; (x86 only supports AL as the source operand for OUTs.)

rept 4                ; For all 4 bitplanes…
    shr ah,  1        ; Shift the next color bit into the x86 carry flag
    sbb al,  al       ; Extend the carry flag to a full byte
                      ; (CF=0 → 0x00, CF=1 → 0xFF)
    out 7Eh, al       ; Write AL to the GRCG tile register
endm
</pre><p>
	Thanks to Turbo C++'s inlining capabilities, the loop body even decompiles
	into a surprisingly nice one-liner. What a beautiful micro-optimization, at
	a place where micro-optimization doesn't hurt and is almost expected.<br />
	Unfortunately, the micro-optimizations went all downhill from there,
	becoming increasingly dumb and undecompilable. Was it really necessary to
	save 4 x86 instructions in the highly unlikely case of a new spark sprite
	<img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhQAAIAPABAOy8qv///yH5BAUKAAEALAAAAABAAAgAAAJIjGGJye28nnygxuMu0hOrwE2h1yyRCZHeqaJgplhnVV6HDdIQrr/5LavxhsIMceVqqXwhlu/zZC6jTtIIBqV2rtFS5zsF53QFADs="
	/> being spawned outside the playfield? That one 2D polar→Cartesian
	conversion function then pointed out Turbo C++ 4.0J's woefully limited
	support for 32-bit micro-optimizations. The code generation for 32-bit
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-02-18" "pseudo-registers"}} is so bad that they almost
	aren't worth using for arithmetic operations, and the inline assembler just
	flat out doesn't support anything 32-bit. No use in decompiling a function
	that you'd have to entirely spell out in machine code, especially if the
	same function already exists in multiple other, more idiomatic C++
	variations.<br />
	Rounding out the third push, we got the TH04/TH05 <code>DEMO?.REC</code>
	replay file reading code, which should finally prove that nothing about the
	game's original replay system could serve as even just the foundation for
	community-usable replays. Just in case anyone was still thinking that.
</p><hr /><p>
	Next up: Back to TH01, with the Elis fight! Got a bit of room left in the
	cap again, and there are <i>a lot</i> of things that would make a lot of
	sense now:
</p><ul>
	<li>TH04 would really enjoy a large number of dedicated pushes to catch up
	with TH05. This would greatly support the finalization of both games.</li>
	<li>Continuing with TH05's bosses and midbosses has shown to be good value
	for your money. Shinki would have taken even less than 2 pushes if she
	hadn't been the first boss I looked at.</li>
	<li>I've got a new idea for
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-07" "properly linking in master.lib and getting rid of the 32-bit build step"}}…
	<small>(<strong>Edit (2022-05-31):</strong> Nope, that didn't work out
	after all.)</small></li>
	<li>Oh, and I also added Seihou as a selectable goal, for the two people out
	there who genuinely like it. If I ever want to quit my day job, I need to
	branch out into safer territory that isn't threatened by takedowns, after
	all.</li>
</ul>
