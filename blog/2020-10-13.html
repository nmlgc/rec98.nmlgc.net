	Done with the .BOS format, at last! While there's still quite a bunch of
	undecompiled non-format blitting code left, this was in fact the final
	piece of graphics format loading code in TH01.
</p><p>
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-28" "Continuing the trend from three pushes ago"}},
	we've got yet another class, this time for the 48×48 and 48×32 sprites
	used in Reimu's gohei, slide, and kick animations. The only reason these
	had to use the .BOS format at all is simply because Reimu's regular
	sprites are 32×32, and are therefore loaded from
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-18" ".PTN files"}}.<br />
	Yes, this makes no sense, because why would you split animations <i>for
	the same character</i> across two file formats and two APIs, just because
	of a sprite size difference?
	This necessity for switching blitting APIs might also explain why Reimu
	vanishes for a few frames at the beginning and the end of the gohei swing
	animation, but more on that once we get to the high-level rendering code.
</p><p>
	Now that we've decompiled all the .BOS implementations in TH01, here's an
	overview of all of them, together with .PTN to show that there really was
	no reason for not using the .BOS API for all of Reimu's sprites:

	And even that last property could simply be handled by branching based on
	the sprite width, and wouldn't be a reason for switching formats. But
	well, it just wouldn't be TH01 without all that redundant bloat though,
	would it?
</p><p>
	The basic loading, freeing, and blitting code was yet another variation
	on the other .BOS code we've seen before. So this should have caused just
	as little trouble as the <code>CBossAnim</code> code… except that
	<code>CPlayerAnim</code> <i>did</i> add one slightly difficult function to
	the mix, which led to it requiring almost a full push after all.
	Similar to {{Blog_PostLink "2020-10-06" "the unblitting code for moving lasers we've seen in the last push"}},
	ZUN tries to minimize the amount of VRAM writes when unblitting Reimu's
	slide animations. Technically, it's only necessary to restore the pixels
	that Reimu traveled by, plus the ones that <i>wouldn't</i> be redrawn by
	the new animation frame at the new X position.<br />
	The theoretically arbitrary distance between the two sprites is, of
	course, modeled by a fixed-size buffer on the stack
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}, coming with the further assumption that the
	sprite surely hasn't moved by more than 1 horizontal VRAM byte compared to
	the last frame. Which, of course, results in glitches if that's not the
	case, leaving little Reimu parts in VRAM if the slide speed ever exceeded
	8 pixels per frame. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} (Which it never does,
	being hardcoded to 6 pixels, but still.). As it also turns out, all those
	bit masking operations easily lead to <i>incredibly</i> sloppy C code.
	Which compiles into incredibly terrible ASM, which in turn might end up
	wasting way more CPU time than the final VRAM write optimization would
	have gained? Then again, in-depth profiling is way beyond the scope of
	this project at this point.
