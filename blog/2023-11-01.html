	And we're back to PC-98 Touhou for a brief interruption of the ongoing <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ssg/issues/42">Shuusou Gyoku Linux port</a>.
	Let's clear some of the Touhou-related progress from the backlog, and use
	the unconstrained nature of these contributions to prepare the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-07-28" "upcoming non-ASCII translations commissioned	by Touhou Patch Center"}}.
	The current budget won't cover all of my ambitions, but it would at least be
	nice if all text in these games was feasibly translatable by the time I
	officially start working on that project.
</p><p>
	At a little over 3 pushes, it might be surprising to see that this took
	longer than the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-11-30" "TH03/TH04/TH05 cutscene system"}}. It's
	obvious that TH02 started out with a different system for in-game dialog,
	but while TH04 and TH05 <i>look</i> identical on the surface, they only
	actually share 30% of their dialog code. So this felt more like decompiling
	2.4 distinct systems, as opposed to one identical base with tons of
	game-specific differences on top.
</p><p>
	The table of contents was pretty popular last time around, so let's have
	another one:

</ol><hr /><p id="th04-{{.Date}}">
	Let's start with the ones from TH04 and TH05, since they are not <i>that</i>
	broken. For TH04, ZUN started out by copy-pasting the cutscene system,
	causing the result to inherit many of the caveats I already described in the
	cutscene blog post:
</p><ul>
	<li>It's still a plaintext format geared exclusively toward full-width
	Japanese text.</li>
	<li>The parser still ignores all whitespace, forcing ASCII text into hacks
	with unassigned Shift-JIS lead bytes outside the second byte of a 2-byte
	chunk.</li>
	<li>Commands are still preceded by a <code>0x5C</code> byte, which renders
	as either a <code>\</code> or a <code>Â¥</code> depending on your font and
	interpretation of Shift-JIS.</li>
	<li>Command parameters are parsed in exactly the same way, with all the same
	limits.</li>
	<li>A lot of the same script commands are identical, including 7 of them
	that were not used in TH04's original dialog scripts.</li>
</ul><p>
	Then, however, he greatly simplified the system. Mainly, this was done by
	moving text rendering from the PC-98 graphics chip to the text chip, which
	avoids the need for any text-related unblitting code, but ZUN also added a
	bunch of smaller changes:
</p><ul>
	<li>The player must advance through every dialog box by releasing any held
	keys and then pressing any key mapped to a game action. There are no
	timeouts.</li>
	<li>The delay for every 2 bytes of text was doubled to 2 frames, and can't
	be overridden.</li>
	<li>Instead of holding <code>ESC</code> to fast-forward, pressing any key
	will immediately print the entire rest of a text box.</li>
	<li>Dialogs run in their own single-buffered frame loop, interrupting the
	rest of the game. The other VRAM page keeps the background pixels required
	for unblitting the face images.</li>
	<li>All script commands that affect the graphics layer are preceded by a
	1-frame delay. ZUN most likely did this because of the single-buffered
	nature, as it prevents tearing on the first frame by waiting for the CRT
	beam to return to the top-left corner before changing any pixels.</li>
	<li>Both boxes are intended to contain up to 30 half-width characters on
	each of their up to 3 lines, but nothing in the code enforces these limits.
	There is no support for automatic line breaks or starting new boxes.</li>
</ul><figure class="fullres pixelated">
	<figcaption class="dynamic"><div>
		While it would seem that TH05 has no issues with ASCII <code>0x20</code>

		trailing byte of a full-width Shift-JIS codepoint. I don't know how
		large the budget for the upcoming non-ASCII translations will be, but

	TH05 then moved from TH04's plaintext scripts to the binary
	<code>.TX2</code> format while removing all the unused commands copy-pasted
	from the cutscene system. Except for <a href="#{{.Date}}-th05-boxwipe">a
	single additional command intended to clear a text box</a>, TH05's dialog
	system only supports a strict subset of the features of TH04's system.<br />
	This change also introduced the following differences compared to TH04:
</p><ul>
	<li>The game now stores the dialog of all 4 playable characters in the same
	file, with a <code>(4 + 1)</code>-word header that indicates the byte offset
	and length of each character's script. This way, it can load only the one
	script for the currently played character.</li>
	<li>Since there is no need for whitespace in a binary format, you can now
	use ASCII <code>0x20</code> spaces even as the first byte of a 2-byte text
	chunk!ð¥³</li>
	<li>All command parameters are now mandatory.</li>
	<li>Filenames are now passed directly by pointer to the respective game
	function. Therefore, they now need to be null-terminated, but can in turn be
	as long as
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-03-27" "the number of remaining bytes in the allocated dialog segment"}}.
	In practice though, the game still runs on DOS and shares its restriction of
	8.3 filenamesâ¦ {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}</li>
	<li>When starting a new dialog box, any existing text in the other box is
	now colored blue.</li>
	<li>Thanks to ZUN messing up the return values of the command-interpreting
	<code>switch</code> function, you can effectively use only <a
	href="#{{.Date}}-linebreak">line break</a> and <a
	href="#{{.Date}}-gaiji">gaiji</a> commands in the middle of text. All other
	commands do execute, but the interpreter then also treats their command byte
	as a Shift-JIS lead byte and places it in text RAM together with whatever
	other byte follows in the script.<br />
	This is why TH04 can and does put its <a
	href="#{{.Date}}-face"><code>\=</code> commands</a> <q>into</q> the boxes
	started with the <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> commands, but TH05 has to
	put its <code>0x02</code> commands before the equivalent <a
	href="{{.Date}}-th05-start"><code>0x0D</code></a>.</li>
</ul><figure {{$vid_op_5.FigureAttrs}}>
	<figcaption class="dynamic"><div>
		Writing the <code>0x02</code> byte to text RAM results in an <img

		/> character, which is simply the PC-98 font ROM's glyph for that
		Shift-JIS codepoint.<br /> Also note how each face change is now
		preceded by two frames of delay.
	</div><div>
		No problem in TH04. Note how the dialog also runs a bit faster â TH04

	For modding these files, you probably want to use <code>TXDEF</code> from
	{{DB_CustomerByID 2}}'s <a
	href="http://lunarcast.net/mystictk.php">MysticTK</a>. It decodes these
	files into a text representation, and its encoder then takes care of the
	character-specific byte offsets in the 10-byte header. This text
	representation simplifies the format a lot by avoiding all corner cases and
	landmines you'd experience during hex-editing â most notably by interpreting
	the box-starting <a href="#{{.Date}}-th05-start"><code>0x0D</code></a> as a
	command to show text that takes a string parameter, avoiding the broken
	calls to script commands in the middle of text. However, you'd still have to
	manually ensure an even number of bytes on every line of text.
</p><p>
	In the entry function of TH05's dialog loop, we also encounter the hack that
	is responsible for properly handling
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-21" "ZUN's hidden Extra Stage replay"}}. Since the
	dialog loop doesn't access the replay inputs but still requires key presses
	to advance through the boxes, ZUN chose to just <a
	href="https://youtu.be/iP2ywlW2u4U?t=217">skip the dialog altogether in the
	specific case of the Extra Stage replay being active</a>, and replicated all
	sprite management commands from the dialog script by just hardcoding
	them.<br />
	And you know what? Not only do I not mind this hack, but I would have
	preferred it over the actual dialog system! The aforementioned <q>sprite
	management commands</q> effectively boil down to manual memory management,
	deallocating all stage enemy and midboss sprites and thus ensuring that the
	boss sprites end up at specific master.lib sprite IDs (<q>patnums</q>). The
	hardcoded boss rendering function then expects these sprites to be available
	at these exact IDsâ¦ which means that <i>the otherwise hardcoded bosses can't
	render properly without the dialog script running before them</i>.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	There is absolutely no excuse for the game to burden dialog scripts with
	this functionality. Sure, delayed deallocation would allow them to blit
	stage-specific sprites, but the original games don't do that; probably
	because none of the two games feature an unblitting command. And <i>even if
	they did</i>, it would have still been cleaner to expose the boss-specific
	sprite setup as a single script command that can then also be called from
	game code if the script didn't do so. Commands like these just are a recipe
	for crashes, <i>especially</i> with parsers that expect fullwidth Shift-JIS
	text and where misaligned ASCII text can easily cause these commands to be
	skipped.
</p><p>
	But then again, it does make for funny screenshot material if you
	accidentally the deallocation and then see bosses being turned into stage
	enemies:

	At the end of the day, you might criticize the system for how its landmines
	make it annoying to mod in ASCII text, but it all works and does what it's
	supposed to. ZUN could have written the cleanest single and central
	Shift-JIS iterator that properly chunks a byte buffer into halfwidth and
	fullwidth codepoints, and I'd still be throwing it out for the upcoming
	non-ASCII translations in favor of something that either also supports UTF-8
	or performs dictionary lookups with a full box of text.<br />
	The only <i>actual</i> bug can be found in the input detection, which once
	again doesn't correctly handle <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/8dfc2cd">the infamous <i>key
	up</i>/<i>key down</i> scancode quirk of PC-98 keyboards</a>. All it takes
	is one wrongly placed input polling call, and suddenly you have to think
	about how the update cycle behind the PC-98 keyboard state bytes
	<i>might</i> cause the game to run the regular 2-frame delay for a single
	2-byte chunk of text before it shows the full text of a box is shown after
	allâ¦ But even this bug is highly theoretical and could probably only be
	observed very, <i>very</i> rarely, and exclusively on real hardware.
</p><hr /><p id="th02-{{.Date}}">
	The same can't be said about TH02 though, but more on that later. Let's
	first take a look at its data, which started out much simpler in that game.
	The <code>STAGE?.TXT</code> files contain just raw Shift-JIS text with no
	trace of commands or structure. Turning on the whitespace display feature in
	your editor reveals how the dialog system even assumes a fixed <i>byte</i>
	length for each box: 36 bytes per line which will appear on screen, followed
	by 4 bytes of padding, which the original files conveniently use to visually
	split the lines via a CR/LF newline sequence. Make sure to disable trimming
	of trailing whitespace in your editor to not ruin the file when modding the
	textâ¦ {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}

	Two boxes from TH02's <code>STAGE5.TXT</code> with visualized whitespace.
	These also demonstrate how the CR/LF newlines only make up 2 of the 4
	padding bytes, and require each line to be padded with two more bytes; you
	could <i>not</i> use these trailing spaces for actual text. Also note how
	the exquisite mixture of fullwidth and halfwidth spaces demands the text to
	be viewed with only the most metrically consistent monospace fonts to
	preserve the intended alignment. ð· It appears quite misaligned on my phone.
</figcaption></figure><p>
	Consequently, everything else is hardcoded â every effect shown between text
	boxes, the face portrait shown for each box, and even how many boxes are
	part of each dialog sequence. Which means that the source code now contains
	<a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/ae2fc2865a74b095bdbc8b469073f43c8cbc2d98/th02_main.asm#L29994-L30170">a

	dedicated hardcoded dialog scripts for <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the
	game's stages.</a><br />
	Without the restriction to a fixed set of scripting commands, TH02 naturally
	gravitated to having the most varied dialog sequences of all PC-98 Touhou
	games. This flexibility certainly facilitated Mima's grand entrance
	animation in Stage 4, or the different lines in Stage 4 and 5 depending on
	whether you already used a continue or not. Marisa's post-boss dialog even
	inserts the number of continues into the text itself â by, you guessed it,
	writing to hardcoded byte offsets inside the dialog text before printing it
	to the screen. {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} But once again, I have nothing to
	criticize here â not even the fact that the alternate dialog scripts have to
	mutate the "box cursor" to jump to the intended boxes within the file. I
	know that some people in my audience like VMs, but I would have considered
	it <i>more</i> bloated if ZUN had implemented a full-blown scripting
	language just to handle all these special cases.
</p><hr /><p id="th02-face-{{.Date}}">
	Another unique aspect of TH02 is the way it stores its face portraits, which
	are infamous for how hard they are to find in the original data files. These
	sprites are actually <i>map tiles</i>, stored in <code>MIKO_K.MPN</code>,
	and drawn using the same functions used to blit the regular map tiles to the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" "tile source area in VRAM"}}. We can only guess
	why ZUN chose this one out of the three graphics formats he used in TH02:
</p><ul>
	<li>BFNT supports transparency, but sacrifices one of the 16 colors to do
	so. ZUN only used 15 colors for the face portraits, but might have wanted to
	keep open the option to use that 16<sup>th</sup> color. The detailed
	backgrounds also suggest that these images were never supposed to be
	transparent to begin with. </li>
	<li>PI is used for all bigger and non-transparent images, but ZUN would have
	had to write a separate small function to blit a 48Ã48 subsection of such an
	image. That certainly wouldn't have stopped him in the TH01 days, but he
	probably was already past that point by this game.</li>
	<li>That only leaves .MPN. Sure, he did have to slice each face into 9
	separate 16Ã16 "map" tiles to use this format, but that's a small price to
	pay in exchange for not having to write any new low-level blitting code,
	especially since he must have already had an asset pipeline to generate
	these files.</li>

	Alright, we've got the text, we've got the faces, let's slide in the box and

	This one image shows off no less than <i>4</i> bugs:
</p><ol>
	<li>ZUN blits the stationary player sprite here, regardless of whether the
	player was previously moving left or right. This is a nice way of indicating
	that Reimu stops moving once the dialog starts, but <i>maybe</i> ZUN should
	have unblitted the old sprite so that the new one wouldn't have appeared on
	top. The game only unblits the 384Ã64 pixels covered by the dialog box on
	every frame of the slide-in animation, so Reimu would only appear correctly
	if her sprite happened to be entirely located within that area.</li>
	<li><p>All sprites are shifted up by 1 pixel in frame 2ï¸â£. This one is not a
	bug in the dialog system, but in the main game loop. The game runs the
	relevant actions in the following order:</p><ol>
		<li>Invalidate any map tiles covered by entities</li>
		<li>Redraw invalidated tiles</li>
		<li>Decrement the Y coordinate at the top of VRAM according to the
		scroll speed</li>
		<li>Update and render all game entities</li>
		<li>Scroll in new tiles as necessary according to the scroll speed, and
		report whether the game has scrolled one pixel past the end of the
		map</li>
		<li>If that happened, pretend it didn't by incrementing the value
		calculated in #3 for all further frames and skipping to
		<code>#8</code>.</li>
		<li>Issue a GDC <code>SCROLL</code> command to reflect the line
		calculated in #3 on the display</li>
		<li>Wait for VSync</li>
		<li>Flip VRAM pages</li>
		<li>Start boss if we're past the end of the map</li>
	</ol><p>
		The problem here: Once the dialog starts, the game has already rendered
		an entire new frame, with all sprites being offset by a new Y scroll
		offset, without adjusting the graphics GDC's scroll registers to
		compensate. Hence, the Y position in 3ï¸â£ is the correct one, and the
		whole existence of frame 2ï¸â£ is a bug in itself. (Wellâ¦ OK, probably a
		quirk because speedrunning exists, and it would be pretty annoying to
		synchronize any video regression tests of the future TH02 Anniversary
		Edition if it renders one fewer frame in the middle of a stage.)
	</p></li>
	<li><p>ZUN blits the option sprites to their position from frame 1ï¸â£. This
	brings us back to
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" "TH02's special way of retaining the previous and current position in a two-element array, indexed with a VRAM page ID"}}.
	Normally, this would be equivalent to using dedicated <code>prev</code> and
	<code>cur</code> structure fields and you'd just index it with the back page
	for every rendering call. But if you then decide to go single-buffered for
	dialogs and render them onto the <i>front</i> page insteadâ¦
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	Note that fixing bug #2 would not cancel out this one â the sprites would
	then simply be rendered to their position in the frame before 1ï¸â£.</p></li>
	<li>And of course, the fixed option sprite ID also counts as a bug.</li>
</ol><p>
	As for the boxes themselves, it's yet another loop that prints 2-byte chunks
	of Shift-JIS text at an even slower fixed interval of 3 frames. In an
	interesting quirk though, ZUN assumes that every box starts with the name of
	the speaking character in its first two fullwidth Shift-JIS characters,
	followed by a fullwidth colon. These 6 bytes are displayed immediately at
	the start of every box, without the usual delay. The resulting alignment
	looks rather janky with Genjii, whose single right-padded <span lang="ja">äº
	</span> kanji looks quite awkward with the fullwidth space between the name
	and the colon. Kind of makes you wonder why ZUN just didn't spell out his
	proper name, <span lang="ja">ççº</span>, instead, but I get the stylistic
	difference.<br/>
	In Stage 4, the two-kanji assumption then breaks with Marisa's three-kanji
	name, which causes the full-width colon to be printed as the first delayed
	character in each of her boxes:
</p><figure>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_prefix_1.SetActive $vid_prefix_2 $vid_prefix_3}}
</figure><hr /><p id="th02-mima-{{.Date}}">
	That's all the issues and quirks in the system itself. The scripts
	themselves don't leave much room for bugs as they basically just loop over
	the hardcoded face ID array at this levelâ¦ until we reach the end of the
	game. Previously, the slide-in animation used the tile invalidation and
	re-rendering system to unblit the box on each frame, which also explained
	why Reimu had to be separately rendered on top. But this no longer works
	with a custom-rendered boss background, and so the game just chooses to
	flood-fill the area with graphics chip color #0:
</p><figure {{$vid_mima_formchange.FigureAttrs}}>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_mima_formchange.SetNoLoop}}
	<figcaption>Then again, transferring pixels from the back page would be just
	as wrong as they lag one frame behind. No way around capturing these 384Ã64
	pixels to main memory hereâ¦ This flood-fill at least ensures that the text
	is not printed on top of a single white pixel, no matter how many bullets
	happen to be moving through the text box area. Unlike the next
	oneâ¦</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	For Mima's final defeat dialog though, ZUN chose to not even show the box.
	He might have realized the issue by that point, or simply preferred the more
	dramatic effect this had on the lines. The resulting issues, however, might
	even have ramifications for such un-technical things as <i>lore</i> and
	<i>character dynamics</i>. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} As it turns out, the <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/ae2fc2865a74b095bdbc8b469073f43c8cbc2d98/th02/main/dialog/dialog.cpp#L573-L586">code
	for this dialog sequence</a> does in fact render Mima's smiling face for all
	boxes?! You only don't see it in the original game because it's rendered to
	the other VRAM page that remains invisible during the dialog sequence:
</p><figure>
	{{call .VideoPlayer $vid_mima_back.SetActive $vid_mima_front}}
	<figcaption>Caution, flashing lights.</figcaption>
</figure><p>
	Here's how I interpret the situation:
</p><ul>
	<li>
		The function that launches into the final part of the dialog script
		starts with <a
		href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/ae2fc2865a74b095bdbc8b469073f43c8cbc2d98/th02_main.asm#L24004-L24056">dedicated
		code to re-render Mima to the back page</a>, on top of the previously
		rendered planet background. Since the entire script runs on the front
		page (and thus, on top of the previous frame) and the game launches into
		the ending immediately after, you don't ever get to see this new partial
		frame in the original game.<br />
		Showing this partial frame would also ensure that you can actually
		<i>read</i> the dialog text without a surrounding box. Then, the white
		letters won't ever be put on top of any white bullets â or, worse, <a
		href="https://youtu.be/bYxWi3WcagI&t=210">be completely invisible if the
		dialog is triggered in the middle of Reimu-B's bomb animation, which
		fills VRAM with lots of white pixels</a>. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
		<br />
		Hence, we've got enough evidence to classify not showing the back page
		as a <a
		href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#zun-bug">ZUN
		bug</a>. ð
	</li>
	<li>
		However, Mima's smiling face jars with the words she says here. Adding
		the face would deviate more significantly from the original game than
		removing the player shot, item, bullet, or spark sprites would. It's
		imaginable that ZUN just forgot about the dedicated code that
		re-rendered just Mima to the back page, but the faces <i>add</i>
		something to the dialog, and ZUN would have <i>clearly</i> noticed and
		fixed it if their absence wasn't intended. Heck, ZUN might have just put
		something related to Mima into the code because TH02's dialog system has
		no way of <i>not</i> drawing a face for a dialog box. Filling the face
		area with graphics chip color #0, as seen in the first and third boxes
		of the Extra Stage pre-boss dialog, would have been an alternative, but
		that would have been equally wrong with regard to the background.<br />
		Hence, the invisible face portrait from the original game is a <a
		href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#zun-quirk">ZUN
		quirk</a>. ðº</li>
</ul><p>
	So, the future TH02 Anniversary Edition will fix the <i>bug</i> by showing
	the back page, but retain the <i>quirk</i> by rewriting the dialog code to
	not blit the face.
</p><hr /><p id="final-{{.Date}}">
	And with that, we've secured all in-game dialog for the upcoming non-ASCII
	translations! The remaining <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the last push made
	for a good occasion to also decompile the small amount of code related to
	TH03's win messages, stored in the <code>@0?TX.TXT</code> files. Similar to
	TH02's dialog format, these files are also split into fixed-size blocks of
	3Ã60 bytes. But this time, TH03 loads all 60 bytes of a line, including the
	CR/LF line breaking codepoints in the original files, into the statically
	allocated buffer that it renders from. These control characters are then
	only filtered to whitespace by ZUN's <code>graph_putsa_fx()</code> function.
	If you remove the line breaks, you get to use the full 60 bytes on every
	line.<br />
	The final commits went to the <code>MIKO.CFG</code> loading and saving
	functions used in TH04's and TH05's <code>OP.EXE</code>, as well as TH04's
	game startup code to finally catch up with
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-21" "TH05's counterpart from over 3 years ago"}}.
	This brought us right in front of the main menu rendering code in both TH04
	and TH05, which is identical in both games and will be tackled in the next
	PC-98 Touhou delivery.
</p><p>
	Next up, though: Returning to Shuusou Gyoku, and adding support for SC-88Pro
	recordings as BGM. Which may or may not come with a slight controversyâ¦
