	50% hype! ðŸŽ‰ But as usual for TH01, even that final set of functions
	shared between all bosses had to consume two pushes rather than oneâ€¦
</p><p>
	First up, in the ongoing series "Things that TH01 draws to the PC-98
	graphics layer that really should have been drawn to the text layer
	instead": The boss HP bar. Oh well, using the graphics layer at least made
	it possible to have this half-red, half-white pattern
	<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAcAAAAPCAIAAACnY0LpAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAAAYSURBVChTY/jPwPAfCFDJUVEISbwoAwMAdbLCPuvaYX8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="" />
	for the middle section.<br />
	This one pattern is drawn by making surprisingly good use of the GRCG. So
	far, we've only seen it used for fast monochrome drawing:
</p><pre>// Setting up fast drawing using color #9 (1001 in binary)
grcg_setmode(GC_RMW);
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 0: (B): (********)
outportb(0x7E, 0x00); // Plane 1: (R): (        )
outportb(0x7E, 0x00); // Plane 2: (G): (        )
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 3: (E): (********)

// Write a checkerboard pattern (* * * * ) in color #9 to the top-left corner,
// with transparent blanks. Requires only 1 VRAM write to a single bitplane:
// The GRCG automatically writes to the correct bitplanes, as specified above
*(uint8_t *)(MK_FP(0xA800, 0)) = 0xAA;</pre><p>
	But since this is actually an 8-pixel <i>tile register</i>, we can set any
	8-pixel pattern for any bitplane. This way, we can get different colors
	for every one of the 8 pixels, with still just a single VRAM write of the
	alpha mask to a single bitplane:
</p><pre>grcg_setmode(GC_RMW); //  Final color: (A7A7A7A7)
outportb(0x7E, 0x55); // Plane 0: (B): ( * * * *)
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 1: (R): (********)
outportb(0x7E, 0x55); // Plane 2: (G): ( * * * *)
outportb(0x7E, 0xAA); // Plane 3: (E): (* * * * )</pre><p>
	And I thought TH01 only suffered the drawbacks of PC-98 hardware, making
	so little use of its actual features that it's perhaps not fair to even
	call it "a PC-98 game"â€¦ Still, I'd say that "bad PC-98 port of an idea"
	describes it best.
</p><p>
	However, after that tiny flash of brilliance, the surrounding HP rendering
	code goes right back to being the typical sort of confusing TH01 jank.
	There's only a single function for the three distinct jobs of
</p><ul>
	<li>incrementing HP during the boss entrance animation,</li>
	<li>decrementing HP if hit by the Orb, and</li>
	<li>redrawing the entire bar, because it's still all in VRAM, and Sariel
	wants different backgrounds,</li>
</ul><p>
	with magic numbers to select between all of these.
</p><p>
	VRAM of course also means that the backgrounds behind the individual hit
	points have to be stored, so that they can be unblitted later as the boss
	is losing HP. That's no big deal though, right? Just allocate some memory,
	copy what's initially in VRAM, then blit it back later using your
	foundational set of blitting functâ€“ oh, wait, TH01 doesn't have this sort
	of thing, right {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} The closest thing,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-27" "once again"}}, are the .PTN functions. And
	so, the game ends up handling these 8Ã—16 background sprites with 16Ã—16
	wrappers around functions for 32Ã—32 sprites. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}
	That's quite the recipe for confusion, <i>especially</i> since ZUN
	preferred copy-pasting the necessary ridiculous arithmetic expressions for
	calculating positions, .PTN sprite IDs, and the ID of the 16Ã—16 quarter
	inside the 32Ã—32 sprite, instead of just writing simple helper functions.
	<s>He <i>did</i> manage to make the result <i>mostly</i> bug-free this time
	around, though!</s> (<strong>Edit (2022-05-31):</strong> Nope, there's a
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-05-31" "potential heap corruption after all, which can be triggered in some fights in test mode (<code>game t</code>) or debug mode (<code>game d</code>)"}}.)
	There's one minor hit point discoloration bug if the red-white or white
	sections start at an odd number of hit points, but that's never the case for
	any of the original 7 bosses.<br />
	The remaining sloppiness is ultimately inconsequential as well: The game
	always backs up <i>twice</i> the number of hit point backgrounds, and thus
	uses twice the amount of memory actually required. Also, this
	self-restriction of only unblitting 16Ã—16 pixels at a time requires any
	remaining odd hit point at the last position to, of course, be rendered
	again {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><hr /><p>
	After stumbling over the weakest imaginable random number
	<s>generator</s>, we finally arrive at the shared bossâ†”orb collision
	handling function, the final blocker among the final blockers. This
	function takes a whopping 12 parameters, 3 of them being references to
	<code>int</code> values, some of which are duplicated for every one of the
	7 bosses, with no generic boss <code>struct</code> anywhere.
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-08-12" "Previously, I speculated that YuugenMagan might have been the first boss to be programmed for TH01"}}.
	With all these variables though, there is some new evidence that SinGyoku
	might have been the first one after all: It's the only boss to use its own
	HP and phase frame variables, with the other bosses sharing the same two
	globals.
</p><p>
	While this function only handles the <i>response</i> to a bossâ†”orb
	collision, it still does way too much to describe it briefly. Took me
	quite a while to frame it in terms of <i>invincibility</i> (which is the
	main impact of all of this that can be observed in gameplay code). That
	made at least <i>some</i> sort of sense, considering the other usages of
	the variables passed as references to that function. Turns out that
	YuugenMagan, Kikuri, and Elis abuse what's meant to be the "invincibility
	frame" variable as a frame counter for some of their animations ðŸ™„<br />
	Oh well, the game at least doesn't call the collision handling function
	during those, so "invincibility frame" is <i>technically</i> still a
	correct variable name there.
</p><hr /><p>
	And that's it! We're finally ready to start with Konngara, in 2021. I've
	been waiting quite a while for this, as all this high-level boss code is
	very likely to speed up TH01 progress quite a bit. Next up though: Closing
	out 2020 with more of the technical debt in the other games.
