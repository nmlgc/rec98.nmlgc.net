<p>
	Turns out I was not <i>quite</i> done with the TH01 Anniversary Edition yet.
	You might have noticed some white streaks at the beginning of Sariel's
	second form, which are in fact a bug that I accidentally added to the
	initial release. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	These can be traced back to a <a
	href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#zun-quirk">quirk</a>
	I wasn't aware of, and hadn't documented so far. When defeating Sariel's
	first form during a pattern that spawns pellets, it's likely for the second
	form to start with additional pellets that resemble the previous pattern,
	but come out of seemingly nowhere. This shouldn't really happen if you look
	at the code: Nothing outside the typical pattern code spawns new pellets,
	and all existing ones are reset before the form transition…
</p><p>
	<i>Except</i> if they're currently showing the 10-frame delay cloud
	animation <img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAPABAAAAAAAAACH/C05FVFNDQVBFMi4wAwEAAAAh/hRLR3kgU09GVCBHSUYgRW5jb2RlcgAh+QQJHgABACwAAAAAEAAQAAACJ4wNqceR7UB7MB4pq9tZo+0xVIh0l1lC40myLddmmIetKmpblbIwBQAh+QQFCgAAACwIAAgAAQABAAACAkQBACH5BAkeAAEALAAAAAAQABAAAAIfjB8AyLb8YDsxTneztTInr3EhBYok6Jkd2iiTmjxcAQAh+QQFCgAAACwIAAgAAQABAAACAkQBADs="
	alt="" />, activated for all pellets during the symmetrical radial 2-ring
	pattern in Phase 2 and left activated for the rest of the fight. These
	pellets will continue their animation after the transition to the second
	form, and turn into regular pellets you have to dodge once their animation
	completed.
</p><p>
	By itself, this is just one more quirk to keep in mind during refactoring.
	It only turned into a bug in the Anniversary Edition because the game tracks
	the number of living pellets in a separate counter variable. After resetting
	all pellets, this counter is simply set to 0, regardless of any delay cloud
	pellets that may still be alive, and it's merely incremented or decremented
	when pellets are spawned or leave the playfield.
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	In the original game, this counter is only used as an optimization to skip
	spawning new pellets once the cap is reached. But with batched
	EGC-accelerated unblitting, it also makes sense to skip the rather costly
	setup and shutdown of the EGC if no pellets are active anyway. Except if the
	counter you use to check for that case can be 0 even if there <i>are</i>
	pellets alive, which consequently don't get unblitted…
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}<br />
	There is an optimal fix though: Instead of unconditionally resetting the
	living pellet counter to 0, we decrement it for every pellet that
	<i>does</i> get reset. This preserves the quirk <i>and</i> gives us a
	consistently correct counter, allowing us to still skip every unnecessary
	loop over the pellet array.

		{{template "vid_caption"}} Also, note how regular unblitting resumes
		once the first pellet gets clipped at the top of the playfield – the
		living pellet counter then gets decremented to -1, and who uses

		counter, right?

	Ultimately, this was a harmless bug that didn't affect gameplay, but it's
	still something that players would have probably reported a few more times.
	So here's a free bugfix:
