	OK, let's decompile TH02's HUD code first, gain a solid understanding of how
	increasing the score works, and then look at the item system of this game.
	Should be no big deal, no surprises expected, let's go!
</p><p>
	‚Ä¶Yeah, right, that's <i>never</i> how things end up in ReC98 land.
	{{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} And so, we get the usual host of newly discovered
	oddities in addition to the expected insights into the item mechanics. Let's
	start with the latter:
<p><ul>
	<li>
		Some regular stage enemies appear to randomly drop either {{template
		"th02_power"}} or {{template "th02_point"}} items. In reality, there is
		very little randomness at play here: These items are picked from a
		hardcoded, repeating ring of 10 items
		(ùÑÜ&nbsp;{{- template "th02_power" -}}
		{{- template "th02_point" -}}{{- template "th02_power" -}}
		{{- template "th02_point" -}}{{- template "th02_point" -}}
		{{- template "th02_power" -}}{{- template "th02_power" -}}
		{{- template "th02_point" -}}{{- template "th02_point" -}}
		{{- template "th02_power" -}}&nbsp;ùÑá), and the only source of
		randomness is the initial position within this ring, which changes at
		the beginning of every stage. ZUN further increased the illusion of
		randomness by only dropping such a semi-random item for every
		4<sup>th</sup> defeated enemy that is coded to drop one, and also having
		enemies that drop fixed, non-random items. I'd say it's a decent way of
		ensuring both randomness and balance.<ul><li>
			There's a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>512</sub> chance for such a semi-random
			item drop to turn into a {{template "th02_bomb"}} item instead ‚Äì
			which translates to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2048</sub> enemies due to the
			fixed drop rate.
		</li><li>
			After using a continue (both after a Game Over, or after manually
			choosing to do so through the Pause menu for whatever reason), the
			next
		<code>(Ôªø<var>Stage number</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</code> semi-random item
		drops are turned into {{template "th02_bigpower"}} items instead.
		</li></ul>
	</li><li><p>
		Items can contribute up to 25 points to the skill value and subsequent
		rating (<span lang="ja">„ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„ÅÆËÖïÂâç</span>) on the final verdict
		screen. Doing well at item collection first increases a separate
		<code>collect_skill</code> value:
		<figure><table id="collect_skill_{{.Date}}">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Item</th>
					<th>Collection condition</th>
					<th><code>collect_skill</code> change</th>
				</tr>
			</thead><tbody>
				<tr>
					<th rowspan="2">{{template "th02_power"}}</th>
					<td>below max power</td>
					<td>+1</td>
				</tr><tr class="item_row">
					<td>at or above max power</td>
					<td>+2</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th rowspan="4">{{template "th02_point"}}</th>
					<td>value == 51,200</td>
					<td>+8</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td>value ‚â•20,000 and &lt;51,200</td>
					<td>+4</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td>value ‚â•10,000 and &lt;20,000</td>
					<td>+2</td>
				</tr><tr class="item_row">
					<td>value &lt;10,000</td>
					<td>+1</td>
				</tr><tr class="item_row">
					<th>{{template "th02_bomb"}}</th>
					<td>with 5 bombs in stock</td>
					<td>+16</td>
			</tbody>
		</table><figcaption>
			Note the lack of anything involving {{template "th02_1up"}} items.
			At the maximum of 5 lives, the item spawn function transforms them
			into bomb items anyway. It <i>is</i> possible though to gain the
			5<sup>th</sup> life by reaching one of the extend scores while a
			{{template "th02_1up"}} item is still on screen; in that case,
			collecting the 1-up has no effect at all.
		</figcaption></figure>
		Every 32 <code>collect_skill</code> points will then raise the
		<code>item_skill</code> by 1, whereas every 16 dropped items will lower
		it by 1. Before launching into the ending sequence,
		<code>item_skill</code> is clamped to the [Ôªø0;&nbsp;25Ôªø] range and
		added to the other skill-relevant metrics we're going to look at in
		future pushes.
	</p></li><li><p>
		When losing a life, the game will drop a single
		{{template "th02_bigpower"}} and 4 randomly picked {{template
		"th02_power"}} or {{template "th02_point"}} items in a random order
		around Reimu's position. Contrary to <a
		href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/index.php?title=Story_of_Eastern_Wonderland%2FGameplay&type=revision&diff=55912&oldid=55911">an
		unsourced Touhou Wiki edit from 2009</a>, each of the 4 does have <span
		class="hovertext" title="Sure, under the assumption that the master.lib RNG is uniformly distributed for every seed, but the intent of ZUN's code is clear in this regard.">an
		equal and independent chance</span> of being either a
		{{template "th02_power"}} or {{template "th02_point"}} item.
	</p></li><li><p>
		Finally, and perhaps <a
		href="https://twitter.com/jazz_cappricio/status/1665508116799053824">most
		interestingly</a>, {{template "th02_point"}} item values! These are
		determined by the top Y coordinate of an item during the frame it is
		collected on. The maximum value of 51,200 points applies to the top 48
		pixels of the playfield, and drops off as soon as an item falls below
		that line. For the rest of the playfield, point items then use a formula
		of <code>(Ôªø28,000&nbsp;-&nbsp;(Ôªø<var>top Y coordinate of item in
		screen space</var>&nbsp;√ó&nbsp;70Ôªø)Ôªø)</code>:
		<figure class="pixelated" id="points-{{.Date}}">
			<img src="{{$points}}" alt="" /><figcaption>
			Point items and their collection value in TH02. The numbers
			correspond to items that are collected while their top Y coordinate
			matches the line they are directly placed on. The upper
			{{template "th02_point"}} item in the image would therefore give
			23,450 points if the player collected it at that specific
			position.<br />
			Reimu collects any item whose 16√ó16 bounding box lies fully within
			the <span style="color: red;">red</span> 48√ó40 hitbox. Note that
			the box isn't cut off in this specific case: At Reimu's lowest
			possible position on the playfield, the lowest 8 pixels of her
			sprite are clipped, but the item hitbox still happens to end exactly
			at the bottom of the playfield. Since an item's Y velocity
			accelerates on every frame, it's entirely possible to collect a
			point item at the lowest value of 2,240 points, on the exact frame
			before it falls below the collection hitbox.

</ul><hr /><p>
	Onto score tracking then, which only took a single commit to raise another
	big research question. It's widely known that TH02 grants extra lives upon
	reaching a score of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 million points. But what hasn't been
	documented is the fact that the game does not stop at the end of the
	hardcoded extend score array. ZUN merely ends it with a sentinel value of
	999,999,990 points, but if the score ever increased beyond this value, the
	game will interpret adjacent memory as signed 32-bit score values and
	continue giving out extra lives based on whatever thresholds it ends up
	finding there. Since the following bytes happen to turn into a negative
	number, the next extra life would be awarded right after gaining another 10
	points at exactly 1,000,000,000 points, and the threshold after that would
	be 11,114,905,600 points. Without an explicit counterstop, the number of
	score-based extra lives is theoretically unlimited, and would even continue
	after the signed 32-bit value overflowed into the negative range. Although
	we certainly have bigger problems once scores ever reach that point‚Ä¶
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	That said, it seems impossible that any of this could ever happen
	legitimately. The current high scores of <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-XY9bb50_k">42,942,800 points on
	Lunatic</a> and <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUmMpA1f-Kc">42,603,800 points on
	Extra</a> don't even reach <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of ZUN's sentinel
	value. Without either a graze or a bullet cancel system, the scoring
	potential in this game is fairly limited, making it unlikely for high scores
	to ever increase by that additional order of magnitude to end up anywhere
	near the 1 billion mark.<br />
	But can we <i>really</i> be sure? Is this a landmine because it's impossible
	to ever reach such high scores, or is it a quirk because these extends
	<i>could</i> be observed under rare conditions, perhaps as the result of
	other quirks? And if it's the latter, how many of these adjacent bytes do we
	need to preserve in cleaned-up versions and ports? We'd pretty much need to
	know the upper bound of high scores within the original stage and boss
	scripts to tell. This value <i>should</i> be rather easy to calculate in a
	game with such a simple scoring system, but doing that only makes sense
	after we RE'd all scoring-related code and could efficiently run such
	simulations. It's definitely something we'd need to look at before working
	on this game's <code>debloated</code> version in the far future, which is
	when the difference between quirks and landmines will become relevant.
	Still, all that uncertainty just because ZUN didn't restrict a loop to the
	size of the extend threshold array‚Ä¶
</p><hr /><p>
	TH02 marks a pivotal point in how the PC-98 Touhou games handle the current
	score. It's the last game to use a 32-bit variable before the later games
	would regrettably start using arrays of <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded
	decimals</a>. More importantly though, TH02 is also the first game to
	introduce the delayed score counting animation, where the displayed score
	intentionally lags behind and gradually counts towards the real one over
	multiple frames. This could be implemented in one of two ways:
</p><ol>
	<li>Keep the displayed score as a separate variable inside the presentation
	layer, and let it gradually count up to the real score value passed in from
	the logic layer</li>
	<li>Burden the game logic with this presentation detail, and split the score
	into two variables: One for the displayed score, and another for the
	<i>delta</i> between that score and the actual one. Newly gained points are
	first added to the delta variable, and then gradually subtracted from there
	and added to the real score before being displayed.</li>
</ol><p>
	And by now, we can all tell which option ZUN picked for the rest of the
	PC-98 games, even if you don't remember
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-03-27" "me mentioning this system last year"}}.
	{{Blog_PostLink "2023-03-30" "Once again"}}, TH02 immortalized ZUN's initial
	attempt at the concept, which lacks the abstraction boundaries you'd want
	for managing this one piece of state across two variables, and messes up the
	abstractions it <i>does</i> have. In addition to the regular score
	transfer/render function, the codebase therefore has
</p><ul>
	<li>a function that transfers the current delta to the score immediately,
	but does not re-render the HUD, and</li>
	<li>a function that adds the delta to the score and re-renders the HUD, but
	does not reset the delta.</li>
</ul><p>
	And ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì I wouldn't have mentioned any of this if it didn't
	result in one bug and one quirk in TH02. The bug resulting from 1) is pretty
	minor: The function is called when losing a life, and simply stops any
	active score-counting animation at the value rendered on the frame where the
	player got hit. This one is only a rendering issue ‚Äì no points are lost, and
	you just need to gain 10 more for the rendered value to jump back up to its
	actual value. You'll probably never notice this one because you're likely
	busy collecting the single {{template "th02_bigpower"}} spawned around Reimu
	when losing a life, which always awards at least 10 points.
</p><p>
	The quirk resulting from 2) is more intriguing though. Without a separate
	reset of the score delta, the function effectively awards the current delta
	value as a one-time point bonus, since the same delta will still be
	regularly transferred to the score on further game frames.<br />
	This function is called at the start of every dialog sequence. However, TH02
	stops running the regular game loop between the post-boss dialog and the
	next stage where the delta is reset, so we can only observe this quirk for
	the pre-boss sequences and the dialog before Mima's form change.
	Unfortunately, it's not all too exploitable in either case: Each of the
	pre-boss dialog sequences is preceded by an ungrazeable pellet pattern and
	followed by multiple seconds of flying over an empty playfield with zero
	scoring opportunities. By the time the sequence starts, the game will have
	long transferred any big score delta from max-valued point items. It's
	slightly better with Mima since you can at least shoot her and use a bomb to
	keep the delta at a nonzero value, but without a health bar, there is little
	indication of <i>when</i> the dialog starts, and it'd be long after Mima
	gave out her last bonus items in any case.<br />
	But two of the bosses ‚Äì that is, Rika, and the Five Magic Stones ‚Äì are
	scrolled onto the playfield as part of the stage script, and can also be hit
	with player shots and bombs for a few seconds before their dialog starts.
	While I'll only get to cover shot types and bomb damage within the next few
	TH02 pushes, there is an obvious initial strategy for maximizing the effect
	of this quirk: Spreading out the A-Type / Wide / High Mobility shot to land
	as many hits as possible on all Five Magic Stones, while firing off a bomb.
</p><figure class="fullres">{{call .VideoPlayer $vid}}<figcaption>
	Turns out that the infamous button-mashing mechanics of the
	player shot are also more complicated than simply pressing and releasing the
	Shot key at alternating frames. Even this result took way too many
	takes.
</figcaption></figure><p>
	Wow, a grand total of 1,750 extra points! Totally worth wasting a bomb for‚Ä¶
	yeah, probably not. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} But at the very least, it's
	something that a TAS score run would want to keep in mind. And all that just
	because ZUN "forgot" a single <code>score_delta = 0;</code> assignment at
	the end of one function‚Ä¶
</p><p>
	And that brings TH02 over the 30% RE mark! Next up: 100% position
	independence for TH04. If anyone wants to grab the {{HTML_Currency 1033}}
	that have now been freed up in the cap: Any small Touhou-related task would
	be perfect to round out that upcoming TH04 PI delivery.
</p>
