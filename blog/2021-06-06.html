<p>
	Who said working on the website was "fun"? That code is a mess.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} This right here is the first time I seriously
	wrote a website from (almost) scratch. Its main job is to parse over a Git
	repository and calculate numbers, so any additional bulky frameworks would
	only be in the way, and probably need to be run on some sort of wobbly,
	unmaintainable "stack" anyway, right? 😛
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-17" "As with the main project"}} though, I'm only
	beginning to figure out the best structure for this, and these new features
	prompted quite a lot of upfront refactoring…
</p><p>
	Before I start ranting though, let's quickly summarize the most visible
	change, the new tag system for this blog!
</p><ul>
	<li>Yes, I manually went through every one of the 82 posts I've written so
	far, and assigned labels to them.</li>
	<li>The per-project ({{HTML_Tag "rec98" nil}} and
	{{HTML_Tag "website" nil}}) and per-game ({{HTML_Tag "th01" nil}}
	{{HTML_Tag "th02" nil}}
	{{HTML_Tag "th03" nil}}
	{{HTML_Tag "th04" nil}}
	{{HTML_Tag "th05" nil}}) tags are automatically generated from the
	database and the Git commit history, respectively. That might have
	ended us up with a fair bit of category clutter, as any single change
	to a tiny aspect is enough for a blog post to be tagged with an
	otherwise unrelated game. For now, it doesn't seem <i>too</i> much of
	an issue though.</li>
	<li>Filtering already works for an arbitrary number of tags. Right now,
	these are always combined with <code class="hovertext"
		title="Or, if formal logic is your thing, a conjunction. ∧"
	>AND</code> – no arbitrary boolean expressions for tag filtering yet.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}</li>
	<li>Adding filters simply works by adding components to the URL path:
	<kbd>https://rec98.nmlgc.net/blog/tag/tag1/tag2/tag3/</kbd>… and so
	on.</li>
	<li>Hovering over any tag shows a brief description of what that tag is
	about. Some of the terms really needed a definition, so I just added one for
	all of them. Hope you all enjoy them!</li>
	<li>These descriptions are also shown on the new
	<a href="/blog/tag">tag overview page</a>, which now kind of doubles as a
	glossary.</li>
</ul><p>
	Finally, the order page now shows the exact number of pushes a contribution
	will fund – no more manual <a href="/faq#duration">divisions</a> required.
	Shoutout to the one email I received, which pointed out this potential
	improvement!
</p><hr /><p>
	As for the "invisible" changes: The one main feature of this website, the
	aforementioned calculation of the progress metrics, also turned out as its
	biggest annoyance over the years. It takes a little while to parse all the
	big .ASM files in the source tree, once for every push that can affect the
	average number of removed instructions and unlabeled addresses. And without
	a cache, we've had to do <i>that</i> every time we re-launch the app server
	process.<br />
	Fundamentally, this is – you might have guessed it – a dependency tracking
	problem, with two inputs: the .ASM files from the ReC98 repo, and the
	Golang code that calculates the instruction and PI numbers. Sure, the code
	has been pretty stable, but what if we do end up extending it one day? I've
	always disliked manually specified version numbers for use cases like this
	one, where the problem at hand could be exactly solved with a hashing
	function, without being prone to human error.
</p><p>
	(Sidenote: That's why I never actively supported thcrap mods that affected
	gameplay while I was still working on that project. We still want to be
	able to save and share replays made on modded games, but I do <i>not</i>
	want to subject users to the unacceptable burden of manually remembering
	which version of which patch stack they've recorded a given replay with.
	So, we'd somehow need to calculate a hash of everything that defines the
	{{HTML_Tag "gameplay" nil}}, exclude the things that don't, and only show
	replays that were recorded on the hash that matches the currently running
	patch stack. Well, turns out that True Touhou Fans™ quite enjoy watching
	the games get broken in every possible way. That's the way ZUN intended the
	games to be experienced, after all. Otherwise, he'd be constantly
	maintaining the games and shipping bugfix patches… 🤷)
</p><p>
	Now, why haven't I been caching the progress numbers all along? Well,
	parallelizing that parsing process onto all available CPU cores seemed
	enough in 2019 when this site launched. Back then, the estimates were
	calculated from slightly over 10 million lines of ASM, which took about 7
	seconds to be parsed on my mid-range dev system.<br />
	Fast forward to P0142 though, and we have to parse 34.3 million lines of
	ASM, which takes about 26 seconds on my dev system. That would have only
	got worse with every new delivery, especially since this production server
	doesn't have as many cores.
</p><p>
	I was thinking about a "doing less" approach for a while: Parsing only the
	files that had changed between the start and end commit of a push, and
	keeping those deltas across push boundaries. However, that turned out to be
	<i>slightly</i> more complex than the few hours I wanted to spend on it.
	And who knows how well <i>that</i> would have scaled. We've still got a few
	hundred pushes left to go before we're done here, after all.
</p><p>
	So with the tag system, as always, taking longer and consuming more pushes
	than I had planned, the time had come to finally address the underlying
	dependency tracking problem.<br />
	Initially, this sounded like a nail that was tailor-made for
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-03" "my favorite hammer, Tup"}}: Move the parser
	to a separate binary, gather the list of all commits via <code>git
	rev-list</code>, and run that parser binary on every one of the commits
	returned. That should end up correctly tracking the relevant parts of
	<code>.git/</code> and the new binary as inputs, and cause the commits to
	be re-parsed if the parser binary changes, right? Too bad that Tup both
	<a href="https://github.com/gittup/tup/issues/238">refuses to track
	anything inside <code>.git/</code></a>, and can't track a Golang binary
	either, due to all of the compiler's unpredictable outputs into its build
	cache. But can't we at least turn off–
</p><blockquote>> The build cache is now required as a step toward eliminating <code>$GOPATH/pkg</code>.
	— <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.12#gocache">Go 1.12 release notes</a>
</blockquote><p>
	Oh, <i>wonderful</i>. Hey, I always liked <code>$GOPATH</code>! 🙁
</p><p>
	But sure, Golang is too smart anyway to require an external build system.
	The compiler's
	<a href="https://golang.org/src/cmd/go/internal/work/buildid.go">build
	ID</a> is exactly what we need to correctly invalidate the progress number
	cache. Surely there is a way to retrieve the build ID for any package that
	makes up a binary at runtime via some kind of reflection, right? Right? …Of
	<i>course</i> not, in the great Unix tradition, this functionality is only
	available as a CLI tool that prints its result to <code>stdout</code>.
	🙄<br />
	But sure, no problem, let's just <code>exec()</code> a separate process on
	the parser's library package file… oh wait, such a thing doesn't exist
	anymore, unless you manually <kbd>install</kbd> the package. This would
	have added another complication to the build process, <i>and</i> you'd
	still have to manually locate the package file, with its version-specific
	directory name. That <i>might</i> have worked out in the end, but figuring
	all this out would have probably gone way beyond the budget.
</p><p>
	OK, but who cares about packages? We just care about one single file here,
	anyway. Didn't they put the official Golang source code parser into the
	standard library? Maybe <i>that</i> can give us something close to the
	build ID, by hashing the abstract syntax tree of that file. Well, for
	starters, one does not simply <i>serialize</i> the returned AST. At least
	into Golang's own, most "native" <a hreF="https://blog.golang.org/gob">Gob
	format</a>, which requires all types from the <code>go/ast</code> package
	to be manually registered first.<br />
	That leaves
	<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/#Fprint">ast.Fprint()</a> as the
	only thing close to a ready-made serialization function… and guess what,
	that one suffers from Golang's typical non-deterministic order when
	rendering any map to a string. 🤦
</p><p>
	Guess there's no way around the simplest, most stupid way of simply
	calculating any cryptographically secure hash over the ASM parser file. 😶
	It's not like we frequently change comments in this file, but still, this
	could have been so much nicer.<br />
	Oh well, at least I <i>did</i> get that issue resolved now, in an
	acceptable way. If you ever happened to see this website rebuilding: That
	should now be a matter of seconds, rather than minutes. Next up: Shinki's
	background animations!
