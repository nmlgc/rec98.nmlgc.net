	Well, well. My original plan was to ship the first step of Shuusou Gyoku
	OpenGL support on the next day after this delivery. But unfortunately, the
	complications just kept piling up, to a point where the required solutions
	definitely blow the current budget for that goal. I'm currently sitting on
	over 70 commits that would take at least 5 pushes to deliver as a meaningful
	release, and all of that is just <i>rearchitecting</i> work, preparing the
	game for a not too Windows-specific OpenGL backend in the first place. I
	haven't even <i>written</i> a single line of OpenGL yetâ€¦ ðŸ¥²<br />
	This shifts the intended Big Release Monthâ„¢ to June after all. Now I know
	that the next round of Shuusou Gyoku features should better start with the
	SC-88Pro recordings, which are much more likely to get done within their
	current budget. At least I've already completed the configuration versioning
	system required for that goal, which leaves only the actual audio part.
</p><p>
	So, TH04 position independence. Thanks to a bit of funding for stage
	dialogue RE, non-ASCII translations will soon become viable, which finally
	presents a reason to push TH04 to 100% position independence after
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-17" "TH05 had been there for almost 3 years"}}. I
	haven't heard back from {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} about how much they want to be
	involved in funding this goal, if at all, but maybe other backers are
	interested as well.<br />
	And sure, it would be entirely possible to implement non-ASCII translations
	in a way that retains the layout of the original binaries and can be easily
	compared at a binary level, in case we consider translations to be a
	critical piece of infrastructure. This wouldn't even just be an exercise in
	needless perfectionism, and we only have to look to Shuusou Gyoku to realize
	why: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5QFqA5fZ48">Players expected
	that my builds were compatible with existing SpoilerAL SSG files</a>, which
	was something I hadn't even considered the need for. I mean, the game is
	open-source {{Blog_PostLink "2022-09-04" "and I made it easy to build"}}.
	You can just fork the code, implement all the practice features you want in
	a much more efficient way, and I'd probably even merge your code into my
	builds then?<br />
	But I get it â€“ recompiling the game yields just yet another build that can't
	be easily compared to the original release. A cheat table is much more
	trustworthy in giving players the confidence that they're still practicing
	the same original game. And given the current priorities of my backers,
	it'll still take a while for me to implement proof by replay validation,
	which will ultimately free every part of the community from depending on the
	original builds of both Seihou and PC-98 Touhou.
</p><p>
	However, such an implementation within the original binary layout would
	significantly drive up the budget of non-ASCII translations, and I sure
	don't want to constantly maintain this layout during development. So, let's
	chase TH04 position independence like it's 2020, and quickly cover a larger
	amount of PI-relevant structures and functions at a shallow level. The only
	parts I decompiled for now contain calculations whose intent can't be
	clearly communicated in ASM. Hitbox visualizations or other more in-depth
	research would have to wait until I get to the proper decompilation of these
	features.<br />
	But even this shallow work left us with a large amount of TH04-exclusive
	code that had its worst parts RE'd and could be decompiled fairly quickly.
	If you want to see big TH04 finalization% gains, general TH04 progress would
	be a very good investment.
</p><hr /><p>
	The first push went to the often-mentioned stage-specific custom entities
	that share a single statically allocated buffer. Back in 2020, I
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-29" "wrongly claimed that these were a TH05 innovation"}},
	but the system actually originated in TH04. Both games use a 26-byte
	structure, but TH04 only allocates a 32-element array rather than TH05's
	64-element one. The conclusions from back then still apply, but I also kept
	wondering why these games used a static array for these entities to begin
	with. You know what they call an area of memory that you can cleanly
	repurpose for things? That's right, a heap! {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
	And absolutely no one would mind one additional heap allocation at the start
	of a stage, next to the ones for all the sprites and portraits.<br />
	However, we are still running in Real Mode with segmented memory. Accessing
	anything outside a common data segment involves modifying segment registers,
	which has a nonzero CPU cycle cost, and Turbo C++ 4.0J is terrible at
	optimizing away the respective instructions. Does this matter? Probably not,
	but you don't take "risks" like these if you're in a permanent
	micro-optimization mindsetâ€¦ {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}
</p><p>
	In TH04, this system is used for:

	Kurumi's symmetric bullet spawn rays, fired from her hands towards the left
	and right edges of the playfield. These are rather infamous for being the

	The single purple pulsating and shrinking safety circle, seen in Phase 4 of

	to the cross bullets, whose spawn function is wrongly limited to 32 entities
	and could theoretically overwrite this circle. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} This
	is strictly landmine territory though:<ul>
		<li>Yuuka never uses these bullets and the safety circle

		<li>She never spawns more than 24 cross bullets</li>
		<li>All cross bullets are fast enough to have left the screen by the
		time Yuuka restarts the corresponding subpattern</li>
		<li>The cross bullets spawn at Yuuka's center position, and assign its
		Q12.4 coordinates to structure fields that the safety circle interprets
		as raw pixels. The game does try to render the circle afterward, but
		since Yuuka's static position during this phase is nowhere near a valid

	These structures only took 1 push to reverse-engineer rather than the 2 I
	needed for their TH05 counterparts because they are much simpler in this
	game. The "structure" for Gengetsu's lines literally uses just a single X
	position, with the remaining 24 bytes being basically padding. The only
	minor bug I found on this shallow level concerns Marisa's bits, which are
	clipped at the right and bottom edges of the playfield 16 pixels earlier

	The rendering code for the three falling stars in the background of Stage 5.

	highest bit in the palette color index of every pixel within the star-shaped
	region. This of course raises the question of how the stage would look like

			The full tile map of TH04's Stage 5, in both dark and fully

			dark view, on the other hand, can freely use colors from the
			illuminated set, since those are unaffected by the <code>OR</code>
			operation.

	Most code that modifies a stage's tile map, and directly specifies tiles via
	their top-left offset in VRAM.<br />
	Thanks to code alignment reasons, this forced a much longer detour into the
	.STD format loader. Nothing all too noteworthy there since we're still
	missing the enemy script and spawn structures before we can call .STD
	"reverse-engineered", but maybe still helpful if you're looking for an
	overview of the format. Also features a buffer overflow landmine if a .STD
	file happens to contain more than 32 enemy scriptsâ€¦ you know, the usual
	stuff.
</li></ul><hr /><p>
	To top off the second push, we've got the vertically scrolling checkerboard
	background during the Stage 6 Yuuka fight, made up of 32Ã—32 squares. This
	one deserves a special highlight just because of its needless complexity.
	You'd think that even a performant implementation would be pretty simple:
</p><ol>
	<li>Set the GRCG to TDW mode</li>
	<li>Set the GRCG tile to one of the two square colors</li>
	<li>Start with <var>Y</var> as the current scroll offset, and <var>X</var>
	as some indicator of which color is currently shown at the start of each row
	of squares</li>
	<li>Iterate over all lines of the playfield, filling in all pixels that
	should be displayed in the current color, skipping over the other ones</li>
	<li>Count down <var>Y</var> for each line drawn</li>
	<li>If <var>Y</var> reaches 0, reset it to 32 and flip <var>X</var></li>
	<li>At the bottom of the playfield, change the GRCG tile to the other color,
	and repeat with the initial value of <var>X</var> flipped</li>
</ol><p>
	The most important aspect of this algorithm is how it reduces GRCG state
	changes to a minimum, avoiding the costly port I/O that we've identified
	time and time again as one of the main bottlenecks in TH01. With just 2
	state variables and 3 loops, the resulting code isn't that complex either. A
	naive implementation that just drew the squares from top to bottom in a
	single pass would barely be simpler, but much slower: By changing the GRCG
	tile on every color, such an implementation would burn a low 5-digit number
	of CPU cycles per frame for the 12Ã—11.5-square checkerboard used in the
	game.<br />
	And indeed, ZUN retained all important aspects of this algorithmâ€¦ but still
	implemented it all in ASM, with a ridiculous layer of x86 segment arithmetic
	on top? {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Which blows up the complexity to 4 state
	variables, 5 nested loops, and a bunch of constants in unusual units. I'm
	not sure what this code is supposed to optimize for, especially with that
	rather questionable register allocation that nevertheless leaves one of the
	general-purpose registers unused. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Fortunately,
	the function was still decompilable without too many code generation hacks,
	and retains the 5 nested loops in all their <code>goto</code>-connected
	glory. If you want to add a checkerboard to your next <a
	href="https://lainnet.superglobalmegacorp.com/blog/2023_05_11_n02.html">PC-98
	demo</a>, just stick to the algorithm I gave above.<br />
	(Using a single XOR for flipping the starting X offset between 32 and 64
	pixels <i>is</i> pretty nice though, I have to give him that.)
</p><hr /><p>
	This makes for a good occasion to talk about the third and final GRCG mode,
	completing the series I started with my previous coverage of the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-12-18" "RMW"}} and
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-01-31" "TCR"}} modes. The TDW (Tile Data Write) mode
	is the simplest of the three and just writes the 8Ã—1 GRCG tile into VRAM
	as-is, without applying any alpha bitmask. This makes it perfect for
	clearing rectangular areas of pixels â€“ or even all of VRAM by doing a single
	<code>memset()</code>:
</p><pre>// Set up the GRCG in TDW mode.
outportb(0x7C, 0x80);

// Fill the tile register with color #7 (0111 in binary).
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 0: (B): (********)
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 1: (R): (********)
outportb(0x7E, 0xFF); // Plane 2: (G): (********)
outportb(0x7E, 0x00); // Plane 3: (E): (        )

// Set the 32 pixels at the top-left corner of VRAM to the exact contents of
// the tile register, effectively repeating the tile 4 times. In TDW mode, the
// GRCG ignores the CPU-supplied operand, so we might as well just pass the
// contents of a register with the intended width. This eliminates useless load
// instructions in the compiled assembly, and even sort of signals to readers
// of this code that we do not care about the source value.
*reinterpret_cast&lt;uint32_t far *&gt;(MK_FP(0xA800, 0)) = _EAX;

// Fill the entirety of VRAM with the GRCG tile. A simple C one-liner that will
// probably compile into a single `REP STOS` instruction. Unfortunately, Turbo
// C++ 4.0J only ever generates the 16-bit `REP STOSW` here, even when using

	However, this might make you wonder why TDW mode is even necessary. If it's
	functionally equivalent to RMW mode with a CPU-supplied bitmask made up
	entirely of 1 bits (i.e., <code>0xFF</code>, <code>0xFFFF</code>, or
	<code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>), what's the point? The difference lies in the
	hardware implementation: If all you need to do is <i>write</i> tile data to
	VRAM, you don't need the <i>read</i> and <i>modify</i> parts of RMW mode
	which require additional processing time. The <i>PC-9801 Programmers'
	Bible</i> claims a speedup of almost 2Ã— when using TDW mode over equivalent
	operations in RMW mode.<br />
	And that's the only performance claim I found, because none of these old
	PC-98 hardware and programming books did any benchmarks. Then again, it's
	not too interesting of a question to benchmark either, as the byte-aligned
	nature of TDW blitting severely limits its use in a game engine anyway.
	Sure, <i>maybe</i> it makes sense to temporarily switch from RMW to TDW mode
	if you've identified a large rectangular and byte-aligned section within a
	sprite that could be blitted without a bitmask? But the necessary
	identification work likely nullifies the performance gained from TDW mode,
	I'd say. In any case, that's pretty deep
	{{HTML_Tag "micro-optimization" nil}} territory. Just use TDW mode for the
	few cases it's good at, and stick to RMW mode for the rest.

	So is this all that can be said about the GRCG? Not quite, because there are
	4 bits I haven't talked about yetâ€¦

	And now we're just 5.37% away from 100% position independence for TH04! From
	this point, another 2 pushes should be enough to reach this goal. It might
	not look like we're <i>that</i> close based on the current estimate, but a
	big chunk of the remaining numbers are false positives from the player shot
	control functions. Since we've got a very special deadline to hit, I'm going
	to cobble these two pushes together from the two current general
	subscriptions and the rest of the backlog. But you can, of course, still
	invest in this goal to allow the existing contributions to go to something
	else.<br />
	â€¦ Well, if the store was actually open. {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}} So I'd better
	continue with a quick task to free up some capacity sooner rather than
	later. Next up, therefore: Back to TH02, and its item and player systems.
	Shouldn't take that long, I'm not expecting any surprises there. (Yeah, I
	know, famous last wordsâ€¦)
