	Didn't <i>quite</i> get to cover background rendering for TH05's Stage 1-5
	bosses in this one, as I had to reverse-engineer two more fundamental parts
	involved in boss background rendering before.
</p><p>
	First, we got the those blocky transitions from stage tiles to bomb and
	boss backgrounds, loaded from <code>BB*.BB</code> and <code>ST*.BB</code>,
	respectively. These files store 16 frames of animation, with every bit
	corresponding to a 16Ã—16 tile on the playfield. With 384Ã—368 pixels to be
	covered, that would require 69 bytes per frame. But since that's a very odd
	number to work with in micro-optimized ASM, ZUN instead stores 512Ã—512
	pixels worth of bits, ending up with a frame size of 128 bytes, and a
	per-frame waste of 59 bytes. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} At least it was
	possible to decompile the core blitting function as <code>__fastcall</code>
	for once. <br />
	But wait, TH05 comes with, and loads, a bomb .BB file for every character,
	not just for the Reimu and Yuuka bomb transitions you see in-gameâ€¦ ðŸ¤”
	Restoring those unused stage tile&nbsp;â†’&nbsp;bomb image transition
	animations for Mima and Marisa isn't that trivial without having decompiled
	their actual bomb animation functions before, so stay tuned!
</p><p>
	Interestingly though, the code leaves out what would look like the most
	obvious optimization: <i>All</i> stage tiles are unconditionally redrawn
	each frame before they're erased again with the 16Ã—16 blocks, no matter if
	they weren't covered by such a block in the previous frame, or <i>are</i>
	going to be covered by such a block in <i>this</i> frame. The same is true
	for the static bomb and boss background images, where ZUN simply didn't
	write a .CDG blitting function that takes the dirty tile array into
	account. If VRAM writes on PC-98 really were as slow as the games'
	<code>README.TXT</code> files claim them to be, shouldn't <i>all</i> the
	optimization work have gone towards minimizing them? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
	Oh well, it's not like I have any idea what I'm talking about here. I'd
	better stop talking about anything relating to VRAM performance on PC-98â€¦

	Second, it finally was time to solve the long-standing confusion about all
	those callbacks that are supposed to render the playfield background. Given
	the aforementioned static bomb background images, ZUN chose to make this
	needlessly complicated. And so, we have <i>two</i> callback function
	pointers: One <i>during</i> bomb animations, one <i>outside</i> of bomb
	animations, and each boss update function is responsible for keeping the
	former in sync with the latter. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}
</p><p>
	Other than that, this was one of the smoothest pushes we've had in a while;
	the hardest parts of boss background rendering all were part of
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-06-10" "the last push"}}. Once you figured out that
	ZUN does indeed dynamically change hardware color #0 based on the current
	boss phase, the remaining one function for Shinki, and all of EX-Alice's
	background rendering becomes very straightforward and understandable.

	Meanwhile, {{DB_CustomerByID 2}} told me about his plans to publicly
	release {{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-17" "his TH05 scripting toolkit"}} once
	TH05's <code>MAIN.EXE</code> would hit around 50% RE! That pretty much
	defines what the next bunch of generic TH05 pushes will go towards:
	{{HTML_TagInline "bullet"}}s, shared {{HTML_TagInline "boss"}} code, and one
	full, concrete boss script to demonstrate how it's all combined. Next up,
	therefore: TH04's bullet firing codeâ€¦? Yes, TH04's. I want to see what I'm
	doing before I tackle the undecompilable mess that is TH05's bullet firing
	code, and <i>you</i> all probably want readable code for that feature as
	well. Turns out it's also the perfect place for {{DB_CustomerByID 15}}'s
	pending contributions.
